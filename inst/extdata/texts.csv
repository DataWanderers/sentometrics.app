Alter a summer surge, consumer spending at the nations retail outlets dipped in September and again last month, the government reported yesterday, and analysts said the decline is an indication that the rapid economic growth of the past year is cooling off The Commerce Department said that a sharp decline in auto sales caused overall retail sales to fall 0.2 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted 213.7 billion as new-car purchases dropped 2 percent September retail sales were revised downward yesterday to show a 0.1 percent decline instead of the 0.3 percent increase originally reported. Meanwhile, a separate report from the Labor Department said that producer prices for finished goods increased 0.1 percent in October following a 0.5 percent rise in September. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the producer price index was flat in October after rising 0.4 percent in September. Despites the increases the Labor Department found in finished goods pricesthose are the prices charged by producers when they first sell a completed itemanalysts said inflation remains well under control, especially so for manufactured products. Over the past 12 months, for instance, the PPI is down 0.2 percent while the core portion of the index, which doesn't include food and energy goods, was up only 0.3 percent. Even though the two monthly declines in retail sales were small, they left the level of sales lower than their average during the July-September period. With consumer spending, which includes goods and services not sold through retailers, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the gross domestic product, analysts said that recent weakness points to a potentially significant slowdown in economic growth in the final three monthsofthis year.
NEW YORK -- Wall Street's public image has improved greatly over the past year, but it still has a long way to go to win the love of Main Street, a new survey indicates. Four out of five people surveyed last month by Louis Harris & Associates agreed that Wall Street generally benefits the nation. The 80 positive response was up sharply from the 70 who held that view in a similar Harris poll last year. But some other findings indicate many Americans still think of the big banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that make up Wall Street as a kingdom populated by large numbers of ethical pygmies. For example, a majority of those surveyed agreed that most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it. A majority also agreed that Wall Street is dominated by greed and selfishness. On the bright side, fewer people subscribed to either of these opinions than only a year ago. And the majority of those surveyed also believe that Wall Streeters generally are just as honest and moral as other people.
What goes up must come down. What goes down must bounce back. As stock prices move higher and lower, many investors cling to the belief that any stock-market suffering will ultimately be rewarded. That's why they hang on to losing stocks and buy on market dips. More important, this belief gives investors the tenacity to invest for the long haul. There's a tendency to believe that good times will follow bad and bad times will follow good, says Steven Thorley, a finance professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management. It's a notion of fairness. But does the stock market really work this way At issue is mean reversion, the idea that there is a some sort of average to which share prices tend to return. Just as trees don't grow to the sky and the meek are supposed to inherit the earth, so there's a conviction that neither good markets nor bad markets can go on for too long. It's not surprising that investors want to believe in reversion to the mean, because it makes the stock market seem less fickle. But it also means we could be in for some rough times.
Will the world slump asks a recent issue of the Economist. It's a good question without a good answer. All that can be said is that the economic crisis that began quietly in Thailand in July has now spread to much of Asia -- including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong -- and moved on to Brazil and even Russia. It could snowball into a broader economic downturn that would drag much of the world with it. Will it The prevailing view is no. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last week that Asia's problems, though serious, won't trigger a U.S. recession. The Economist also doubts a global slump. But optimism needs to be tempered, because the optimists have -- so far -- been wrong. The crisis is already worse than they expected, and plenty could still go wrong. Banking crises across Asia are a possibility. Another bad omen the decision of the Mercosur trading bloc Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay to raise tariffs 25 percent. This could signal a protectionist spiral that would depress world trade. The best that can be expected is that the crisis harms only a handful of countries. For them, economic growth drops sharply. Consider new estimates from Nariman Behravesh, chief global forecaster for Standard & Poor's DRI. The table below contrasts his forecasts before and after Asia's latest stock market and currency declines in late October and early November. Japan stumbles because its exports to Asia falter. And other countries are overextended. What we're seeing today is the tail end of the capital flow cycle, says economist Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland. In the 1990s, these countries have received massive foreign investment. Too much money flowed too quickly. First, foreign capital mostly dollars was converted into local currencies. Bad loans were made, bad projects were financed. Next, local consumers and companies converted some local currency back into foreign exchange to buy imports. Trade deficits swelled. Everyone's a genius in a boom, says Reinhart. And now the boom is over. Countries must curb trade deficits because they no longer receive the foreign capital needed to gorge on imports. Interest rates go up to slow spending. Brazil raised tariffs to choke imports. Other countries let their currencies depreciate this makes imports more expensive and exports less expensive. Yet, Behravesh doesn't expect the world economy to slump. He's cut his 1998 forecast for global growth only slightly, from 2.9 to 2.5 percent. Though the United States and Europe lose some exports, their economies continue to expand. Most developed countries escape the crisis.
Dell Computer said third-quarter profit rose 71 percent, to 248 million, amid surging demand for its business and consumer machines. The Round Rock, Tex.-based company, the largest seller of computers by mail, said sales rose 58 percent, to 3.19 billion, from 2.02 billion. The results surpassed the expectations of financial analysts surveyed by First Call, but were released after the close of financial markets. Before the results, Dell stock fell 4.4 percent, or 3.62 12, to 79.75, amid a sharp retreat on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Williams Cos. said it agreed to buy Mapco, the biggest U.S. pipeline system moving propane and butane, for 3.4 billion in stock and assumed debt. Williams, one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies in the United States, will give 46.15 in stock for each Mapco share, or 42 percent more than Mapco's average price over the past three months. Williams will pay out 2.65 billion in stock and assume 750 million in debt. The Justice Department said it was investigating whether established airlines engaged in predatory airfare pricing by undercutting smaller carriers at some airports. We are looking at the issue of hub dominance and new entrants in several areas, Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the antitrust division, said in Washington. Klein would not comment on which airlines were under investigation. Hollinger International is selling more than 160 newspapers in 11 states, or about 40 percent of its U.S. community newspaper group, to a buyout firm for 310 million. The company, whose newspapers include the Chicago Sun-Times and the Daily Telegraph of London, said the sales to Los Angeles-based Leonard Green & Partners will help pay for its recent acquisition of the Post-Tribune in Gary, Ind. Telemundo Group, a Spanish-language television network, is being acquired for about 440 million by investors including financier Leon Black. The investment group consists of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Liberty Media Group, Black's Apollo Management and the investment firm Bastion Capital Fund. Black also is chairman of Telemundo and owns about 35 percent of the Miami-based network, which owns seven stations in the United States and Puerto Rico and sells programming to about 70 affiliates.
The Postal Service and Wall Street will remain open on Friday, Dec. 26, despite President Clinton's order giving federal workers the day off. There's a longstanding tradition of giving federal workers a four-day weekend when Christmas falls on a Thursday. In 1986, the last time it happened, the Postal Service also continued working. Other federal employees may also be required to work for reasons of national security, defense or other public need. Banks are likely to be open on Dec. 26 as usual, because the Federal Reserve banks around the country will be open, as will their clearing banks, according to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. The Federal Reserve Board itself, the policy-making entity in Washington, will be closed, said Joseph Clyne, assistant to the board. Mr. Clyne said the Federal Reserve will be issuing the required weekly condition statement regarding federal reserve banks that day. The New York Stock Exchange also will continue with its planned operations that day, closing early at 1 p.m. EST, a spokesman said. The Nasdaq Stock Market, which tends to mirror the schedule of the Big Board, also plans a 1 p.m. closing, as does the American Stock Exchange.
NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks were moderately lower on Wednesday, while the broad market edged higher in choppy preholiday trading. While trading activity was lighter than usual, it was good volume for the day before Thanksgiving, said James Herrick, managing director of trading at Robert W. Baird. After being closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, the stock market will shut early today, at 1 p.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.17, or 0.18, to 7794.78. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.82, or 0.09, to 951.64. Banks were among the day's biggest winners. Bank of New York rose 1 18 to 53 18, BankBoston gained 1 1316 to 88 34, and Firstar jumped 2 316 to 39 916. However, First Chicago NBD, which Tuesday was sharply higher on takeover speculation, said it isn't in talks with Banc One, which was named as its suitor, and its stock slid 1516 to 78 18. Banc One was down 316 to 51 516.
Here is something investors haven't heard for a while Coca-Cola stock is cheap. Calling a megacapitalization blue chip trading at 38 times earnings cheap is heresy to many investors. But the fact that many strategists and even some conservative investors can now make that argument shows how the lowest interest rates in nearly two years are transforming the stock-valuation landscape. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades at 23.54 times the past 12 months' earnings, not far from a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 28.35 to 7823.13 on Friday, is at 20.10 times earnings. Yet some strategists argue the combination of falling interest rates and still-robust earnings forecasts suggests stocks are a better value than they have been in a long time, including many high PE blue chips like Coke. Again, this may be a surprise to investors still jittery after the Oct. 27 stock plunge and the gyrations in global markets since then. And the same lower-rate scenario that supports the bullish argument also makes the stock market more vulnerable to higher rates than it has been in some time. But here is the bullish case Lower interest rates raise the present value of a company's future earnings. That is because an investor puts a higher price on future earnings if he or she will earn less in competing investments, like bonds. Furthermore, the effect accelerates the lower rates go. A drop in bond yields from 7 to 6 boosts valuations far more than the drop from 8 to 7, a dynamic long understood by bond investors but not widely appreciated by stock investors.
MOSCOW -- Russia's central bank raised interest rates for the second time in less than a month, giving up efforts to shore up its slumping currency and bond markets with direct intervention. The move came late in the day as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank seemed set to step in with nearly 2 billion in loans by year end. A senior U.S. administration official suggested yesterday that more IMF assistance could be made available if Russia improved its tax collection record. That would make it possible for the IMF to help them through any problems they might have, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said. The World Bank is going to provide about 800 million in the next several months, he added, as part of its important support of ongoing structural reform in Russia. And German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sunday pledged to help Russia win more financial support. Early yesterday, the Russian central bank sharply raised its daily intervention limit for the dollar. The ruble recorded its sharpest one-day drop this year, falling to the central bank's limit of 5,963 rubles per dollar from 5,931 Friday. Government bond prices also plunged. Yields surged to 35 to 45-the highest levels in a year.
Rereading old predictions can be disheartening for many economists. But occasionally they can find a nugget of accuracy in forecasts that largely seem to have gone awry. Ask Bernard Weinstein. The economist recently looked back at the rosy forecasts of the 1980 Commission of the Future of the South, a group of the region's business, political and educational leaders. The group studied 14 states from Virginia and Texas in an attempt to track and project demographic trends to help plan for education needs, as well as economic and infrastructure development. Among the task force's particularly bold predictions Southerners would finally make as much money as the rest of Americans by the year 2000. Although it isn't turning out that way for most of the South, Mr. Weinstein told a September symposium at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Florida is on track to making his prediction come true there. Indeed, the Sunshine State's per-capita income of 24,104 rose a solid four percentage points to 99 of the national average, and Mr. Weinstein says it may well catch up by about the start of the millennium. Meanwhile, for the South as a whole, per-capita income in the 14 states surveyed rose one percentage point to 90 of the U.S. average. At the same time, the South's cost of living increasingly parallels the nation's, so lower costs are less likely to offset lower income.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan tonight urged developing nations to move as quickly as possible to reform their banking systems, which he called the weaker links in our international financial system. In a speech delivered to the Economic Club of New York, Greenspan laid much of the blame for the current financial turmoil in several Asian nations on the way in which their governments failed to adequately regulate and supervise their banking systems, while at the same time directing banks to provide loans to favored borrowers. What is wrong with policythat is, politically drivenloans Potentially nothing if they were made to firms to finance expansions that just happened to coincide with a rise in consumer or business or overseas demand for their newly produced products, the Fed chairman said. Unfortunately, this is often not the case, he said. Policy loans, in too many instances, foster misuse of resources, unprofitable expansions, losses, and eventually loan defaults. Huge losses on those and other types of loans, particularly those used to finance new real estate ventures, have crippled the banking See GREENSPAN, BX4, Col. 1
The financial turmoil in several Asian countries has begun to have a direct impact on the U.S. economy in the form of reduced orders for manufactured goods and agricultural products and additional competition from imports, according to the Federal Reserve. That finding turned up in the Fed's latest nationwide survey of economic conditions, the results of which were released yesterday. So far, however, the impact is small, and the survey found a continued moderate pace of economic growth nationwide since the previous survey in October. The surveys are done eight times a year by the Fed's 12 regional banks as part of the preparation for the central bank's policymaking sessions. Many financial analysts expect Fed policymakers to make no change in short-term interest rates when they meet next, on Dec. 16. In addition to the current lack of inflation pressure, forecasters predict that a rising trade deficit with the troubled Asian nations will trim half a percentage point or more off U.S. economic growth next year, probably shaving it to about 2 percent to 2.5 percent. That ought to reduce concerns of Fed officials that the economy might overheat in 1998, analysts said. Surveyors for the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Federal Reserve banks all found that demand for U.S. goods by Asian importers is weakening.
I would like to thank Messrs. Culver, Scott and Hawn Letters to the Editor, Nov. 10 for the opportunity to correct several of their common misunderstandings about fuel grade ethanol. Dave Culver, in his concern over the projected production cost of ethanol, makes no mention of the true costs of imported oil. When externalities such as environmental and health costs, the loss of domestic jobs and basic industries, the trade deficit, commitments of military resources to ensure the free flow of oil from the Middle East and threats to our energy and national security are included, the true cost of imports even now exceeds 100bbl, according to the General Accounting Office. Mr. Culver is off by a factor of almost 10 in his claim that Vehicles that consume a 10 mixture of gasohol' typically see a 20 loss in fuel mileage. Between 2 and 4 is correct. He is a bit closer in his description of E-85 vehicles. At this time, they experience about a 20 reduction in range compared to gasoline. That will improve with higher compression ratio engines allowed by ethanol's 113 octane. He is just flat wrong about fires and fuel system incompatibility with ethanol. John W. Scott is correct in warning that the production of ethanol and other biofuels from feed grains and oilseeds, from agriculture and forestry residues, fast growing trees and grasses and well as from urban biomass heading for the dump, must ensure environmental integrity from the dirt to the tailpipe. The sloshing down the river of 15 gallons of top soil for every gallon of ethanol simply does not occur with modern, environmentally sound farming practices including crop rotation, conservation tillage, planting and harvesting, filter strips and the scientific use of agricultural chemicals. As the nation commercializes the conversion of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulosic biomass, the planting of grasses and trees on erodible land will bring increasing levels of top soil to farm lands, a process already well under way. Richard G. Hawn needs to visit Brazil to verify his claims of poor-running cars and double-the-size gas tanks. Essentially all cars in Brazil run on ethanol, either in blends of 22 ethanol78 gasoline or 99 ethanol a little touch of denaturant to keep the imbibers away. They run well and the public is pleased. The fuel tanks are about 20 larger than they would be if straight gasoline were used. He is right about the Btu content of ethanol being lower than gasoline -- 76,000 Btu compared with about 119,000 for gasoline. But he neglected to mention that the increased thermal efficiency of ethanol when combusted and its much higher octane permits engine designs that will almost remove the Btu advantage of gasoline. He also failed to mention that air quality in San Paulo Brazil, with a population of 14 million, is better than in Los Angeles, New York City or Houston Texas. There are, of course, externalities in this observation -- and I will show mine when the oil companies show theirs.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5-Stocks rallied today, setting records forthe first time in nearly two months, as a surprisingly strong economic report eased worries about weak profits instead of spurring the usual attack of inflation jitters. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98,97 to 8149.13,just llOpoints shy of its alltime best dose of 8259.31 on Aug. 6. But the highlight of the rally was the return to record levels by the Standard & Poor's 509stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index. The two broad-market measures closed at record highs for the first time since Oct 7, a few weeks before Wall Street succumbed to a global sell-off caused by an economic crisis in Asia. For the week, the Dow gained 326 points, or more than 4 percent giving it a 26 percent gain for 1997 with less than a month to go. The S&P 500 and the NYSE composite are both up more than 30 percent this year.

Summers rushed to Capitol Hill to explain why it was happening and what could be done to stop iL Around the world, financial markets waited nervously for their testimony. But for an hour, the two men sat silently as members of the House Banking Committee lectured them about human rights violations in Indonesia, the declining wages of blue-collar workers and the folly of using money from U.S. taxpayers to bail out foreign countries that were stealing American jobs. When they finally got a chance to speak, Greenspan and Summers pleaded with committee members to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund as the best way to contain the Asian contagion. But their pleas fell on deaf ears Congress adjourned for a two-month holiday after stripping the new IMF money from This episode is the latest illustration of what many observers view as a retreat from the internationalist consensus that has governed U.S. economic policy for 50 years.

For giant disk-drive maker Seagate Technology Inc., there has been no shortage of ripple effects from the economic crises coursing through Asia. The hard part has been figuring out whether the news is bad or good. Consider In October, the world's biggest drive maker took a 63 million charge because of a badly timed hedging bet on the plunging currencies of Thailand and Malaysia, where Seagate has many of its plants. While the charge was a shock for shareholders, there was also an upside The currency declines that triggered it also meant lower manufacturing costs for Seagate, the biggest private employer in those two countries. That bit of good news, though, was quickly offset by bad news in South Korea, where a weakening won gave Seagate's competitors like Samsung Group the chance to cut their prices. Panic time Not so fast. Because of the same South Korean crisis, the likes of Samsung are facing a credit crunch that appears likely to curb their ability to expand operations. That's potentially a big plus for Seagate, because the company is struggling with an industrywide glut of disk drives. But a scarcity of credit is also bad news, of course, since consumers and corporations in South Korea and the rest of Asia will be buying fewer personal computers, in which most of Seagate's drives are used. Confused Join the crowd. U.S. investors are clearly alarmed about the fate of America's highflying high-technology multinationals, and are threatening to stampede out of the sector. The tech-laden Nasdaq Stock Market has sunk nearly 5 this week. Such behavior isn't completely irrational, because the net effect of the Asian turmoil is bound to be negative, at least in the short term. Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, excluding China, represent about a quarter of the global economy, and their collective growth rate may go from robust to nil next year. More than a third of America's 150 billion of high-tech exports go to the region, and the sales of the units of U.S. companies located there dwarf those exports.
This may come as a surprise to those of you who have bought anything in Connecticut recently, but The state is a pretty affordable place to live. How can that be After all, prices in Connecticut for everything from utilities to groceries and health care are 22 higher than the nationwide average, according to an index compiled by the latest edition of the Connecticut Economy, a quarterly publication from the University of Connecticut. Only Massachusetts and Alaska have higher cost-of-living indexes, says economist Steven Lanza, managing editor of the review. But, Mr. Lanza says, that only tells part of the story. Prices by themselves are meaningless. They're high here, low there, but what does that really tell you Mr. Lanza says. You have to look at purchasing power. According to the U.S. Commerce Department's most recent figures, Connecticut leads the nation in per-capita personal income. At 33,875 a year, income is 39 above the national average. So prices are relatively high here, Mr. Lanza says, but incomes are higher still.
NEW YORK -- Favorable inflation data and the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged helped the Treasury market edge higher in listless, range-bound trading. Because much of the positive news was already priced into the market, Treasurys didn't react with much enthusiasm to news that buttressed the market's already strong fundamentals. The bellwether 30-year bond rose 532, or 1.5625 for a bond with a 1,000 face value, at 102 732. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.956 from 5.967. Shorter-term securities moved little, however. The two-year note, for example, fell 132, or 0.313. Few market participants were surprised when the Fed's Open Market Committee elected not to change monetary policy during its last policy meeting of the year, keeping the fed funds target rate at 5.50. The decision was expected because the Fed had provided the market with no indication that it was contemplating a rate change, and because a rate increase would likely have handicapped still-struggling Asian economies.
Spine-Tech Inc., which makes surgical implants to treat spinal disorders, agreed to be acquired by Switzerland's Sulzer Medica Ltd. for 595 million. The boards of both companies approved Sulzer Medica's bid of 52 a share, which represents a 14 premium over Monday's closing price for Minneapolis-based Spine-Tech. In trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Spine-Tech shares rose 6, or 13, to 51.50. Analysts played down prospects of a rival bidder emerging to challenge Sulzer Medica, a publicly traded unit of engineering giant Sulzer AG. They said Spine-Tech's sales and marketing efforts should receive a sizable boost from the deal. Spine-Tech is one of a handful of companies pioneering a minimally invasive surgical implant to treat degenerative disorders of the spine. The procedure, which employs hollow titanium tubes as a biological scaffold, is less arduous for patients than traditional surgical treatment and also requires briefer hospitalization -- a powerful argument to cost-conscious health-care providers. Spine-Tech faces competition from U.S. Surgical Corp.'s Surgical Dynamics unit, which currently markets its Ray Threaded fusion cage, and from SofamorDanek Group Inc., which recently was denied U.S. approval for its spinal-cage product. Analysts expect the Sofamor product to eventually get marketing clearance.
CLINTON IS POISED to extend the June deadline for U.S. troops' mission in Bosnia. The president is expected to discard the idea of an exit date and list criteria to be met before the international force can go home. Privately, U.S. officials concede troops may have to stay several years. There are now 8,500 U.S. troops in Bosnia, and, in one scenario, 7,000 would stay. There have been no combat casualties and voter opposition is muted, but the extension issue provokes anger in Congress. Many drugs donated in the Balkan war were unusable, and a New England Journal of Medicine study says donors dump outdated supplies on the U.N. --- The budget deficit is shrinking faster than had been projected, and the fiscal '98 shortfall could be as much as 30 billion less than the 58 billion forecast, according to soon-to-be-released administration and congressional estimates. Clinton aides are already drawing up scenarios for using any fiscal '99 surplus.
South Korea's newly elected president, Kim Dae Jung, fought a losing battle today to bolster the confidence of financial markets, which fell sharply amid fears that he will bend to labor unions and other domestic political pressures rather than instituting tough economic reform measures. Despite repeated assurances from Kim and his aides, who said the president-elect intends to comply fully with economic reform guidelines set by the International Monetary Fund IMF, the South Korean stock market dropped 5.1 percent and the South Korean currency, the won, fell as much as 11 percent before closing down 4.5 percent. It will take all the wisdom we have to restore the economic situation, said Kim's chief of staff, Jay Yoo. It will take some time. We'll work together with foreign investors and the IMF. I don't know how long it will take. Traders and business leaders said they were worried because Kim initially balked at the terms of the IMF's 57 billion bailout of South Korea, even though he later muted his criticism and declared his full support for the guidelines. On his first day as president-elect, Kim tried hard to dispel doubts about his determination to tackle South Korea's tough economic problems that include a weak banking system, inefficient industrial conglomerates and a foreign debt crisis threatening to strangle the world's 11th-largest economy.
OAKLAND, Calif. -- Kaiser Permanente Chairman David Lawrence has had a productive year in managed care He has negotiated three major mergers, increased his health plan's membership 15 to almost nine million people and led a high-profile industry coalition to improve consumer safeguards. But asked whether he is having fun, Dr. Lawrence has a one-word answer No. Kaiser, the industry's giant, now expects a loss of 50 million or more this year. Credit-rating agencies are downgrading its debt. Big employers are annoyed with its plans to raise rates next year. In Texas, it paid a 1 million penalty to settle charges of skimping on coverage. And in the biggest personal jolt, Dr. Lawrence says, Kaiser's nurses have picketed his home in a campaign to fight job cuts, harassing my wife and frightening my daughter. The honchos at other health-maintenance organizations aren't having much fun, either. Just when HMOs seemed to offer an answer to the intractable problems of soaring health-care costs, the bottom fell out. Some of the industry's biggest names are racking up losses, grappling with unexpected rises in medical bills, struggling to absorb costly mergers and squirming under a backlash from consumers, doctors and politicians. Wall Street is fearful and unhappy. On Thursday, shares of Aetna Inc. tumbled more than 10 after the chief financial officer of its core unit suddenly resigned amid problems in digesting the 8.9 billion acquisition of an HMO giant, U.S. Healthcare. Oxford Health Plans Inc. has lost more than 75 of its stock-market value since late October, and its operating losses in the past six months could top 200 million. PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a big California HMO, is taking a pretax charge of 145 million related to losses on an acquisition its stock is down more than 20 since Thanksgiving. Cigna Corp. and Prudential Insurance Co. are having HMO problems, too.
Stock prices regained some ground following Friday's losses, as the bond-market rally gathered steam and sent interest rates to four-year lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased more than two-thirds of Friday's drop of 90.21 points, rising 63.02 to 7819.31, despite another day of Asian declines. Still, while the market ended in positive territory, it wasn't a smooth ride. Midway through the day, most benchmarks slumped into negative territory as more investors took advantage of the early-morning gains to sell and take profits. With the interest-rate environment stable to improving, there's no question that the focus continues to shift to earnings, said Warren Epstein, trading head at Richard A. Rosenblatt in New York. The interest-rate picture remains the most benign in many years. Yesterday, the 30-year bellwether Treasury rose 1832, or 5.625 per 1,000 bond, to yield 5.87, the lowest level since October 1993. The rally was fueled in part by the latest slump in Asian stock markets. Rates move in the opposite direction to bond prices.
You say you've got a handle on the Asian economic crisis and the 1998 congressional races but remain consumed by a feeling of emptiness And you learned more than you wanted to this year about the Mir space station and Princess Diana but less than you need to about the rest of the world Fear not. Here, boiled down from wire dispatches, was the real news of 1997. OSLO -- A Norwegian court ruled that beer-spitting members of a faux-hillbilly band were engaging in legitimate artistic expression. APPLETON, Wis. -- A woman sued her former psychiatrist for malpractice, claiming he convinced her she had 120 personalities -- and then charged her insurance company for group therapy. HANOI -- A drop in the price of python meat caused economic difficulties in Vietnam's southern province of Ca Mau. NICOSIA, Cyprus -- British Royal Marines were barred from training on Cyprus after police found three of them sitting naked outside a pub singing God Save the Queen.
As a strong economy continues to drive down the federal deficit, pressure is building in both parties to recast last summers balanced budget deal to make room for additional tax cuts and domestic spending to gain advantage in the 1998 midterm elections. Although the White House has decided against offering any major proposals to cut or simplify taxes in President Clintons State of the Union address next month and forthcoming budget, a senior administration official said this week all that could change if the deficit picture continues to improve. Were not ruling out further steps in tax reform or changes later in the year, said Gene Sperling, head of the White House National Economic Council Well look at a number of things, but as always the key issue is how you would pay for it and whether it meets the presidents guidelines for fairness. Republicans, for their part, have resisted until now efforts to change the budget agreement to allow for more spending for highways and GOP priorities. But with the economy continuing to improveand the election campaign soon upon themHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich R-Ga. and other leaders have begun speculating how they might spend future surpluses. - , Congress and the Clinton administration have plenty of ideas for more spending and tax reliefincluding elimination of the marriage penalty for couples who file jointly arid jre-duction in die burden of the payroll taxin the event the government finds itself within striking distance of a surplus in the coming months.'.
For people who always like to have something to worry about, here's the trendy new worry for 1998. Price deflation. What would happen to businesses, jobs and the stock market if average consumer prices dropped The answer Things could be just fine. Obsessive brooders should exercise their worry beads over something else. The consumer price index CPI falls when enough businesses cut the prices on things they sell, or when prices decline sharply for a couple of major items within the index. The 12-month inflation rate is running at 1.8 percent. Prices rose modestly for most goods and services, but energy and automobiles showed declines. This kind of selective price cutting goes on all the time without hurting the economy, says Irwin Kellner, president of Kellner Economic Advisers in Port Washington, N.Y.
NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasurys posted modest losses yesterday as investors made some last-minute portfolio adjustments before the end of the year. Elsewhere in trading, South Korean bonds continued to improve, as U.S. banks appear poised to roll over short-term Korean debt obligations and as some fund managers bought Korean debt issues. Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was off 932 point, or 2.81 for a bond with 1,000 face value, at 102 2432. Its yield rose to 5.92 from 5.90 at Friday's market close, as bond yields move the opposite way as prices. The day's declines took place on low volume and were driven by year-end portfolio adjustment, not a significant change in market sentiment, traders said. Illiquid conditions exaggerated price movements in the bond market, some added. Also working against bonds, stock prices jumped, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 113.10 points.
The housing market is about to close one of the best sales years ever. But 1998's housing market may lack some of this year's zing. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in November fell less than 1 to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.38 million homes, compared with 4.39 million in October and 4.06 million in November 1996. Barring unexpectedly bleak results for December, the trade group expects total 1997 existing-home sales to top 4.2 million, the highest number since the group began tracking sales in 1968 and above last year's 4.09 million. Meanwhile, the group estimates that the median sale price of existing homes will have risen 4.9 during 1997, more than double the inflation rate. Half of all homes sell for above the median price, while half sell for less. The surge has surprised analysts, who at the beginning of 1997 were expecting home sales to slip a bit. But a strong economy boosted employment levels and consumer confidence, and mortgage rates were consistently low. Fat gains in the stock market also made Americans more willing to spend more money on a big purchase like a home. Perhaps most important, the American population has moved into prime home-buying age groups. Today's baby boomers are now between the ages of 33 and 51 years old. At the younger end of that spectrum, homeowners typically buy a first home or sell a smaller first home to trade up to a house with enough room for their growing families. At the older end, empty-nesters are inclined to sell their big homes and buy smaller but fancier homes near the golf course.
A 910 million settlement of an investor class action lawsuit alleging that 30 brokerage firms conspired to rig prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market has been given preliminary approval by a federal judge. In New York, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet allowed attorneys in the case to place newspaper advertisements notifying investors of their eligibility to collect money under the settlement. The judge is expected to hold another hearing next year before deciding whether to give the settlement final approval. Sales of existing homes edged 0.2 percent lower in November from a record level the month before, a trade group said. Existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million units last month, down from 4.39 million units in October, the National Association of Realtors said. The drop was the result of declines in the Northeast and Midwest. The Justice Department sued to block Alcoa's 250 million purchase of Reynolds Metals' aluminum mill and other property in Alabama. The department, in a suit filed in federal court in Alabama, alleged that the acquisition would lead to higher prices for aluminum used to make beverage cans. It noted that Alcoa doesn't plan to reopen a Muscle Shoals aluminum rolling mill that Reynolds will close before selling the plant to Alcoa. Richmond-based Reynolds said its legal team will review its options before it comments further. Alcoa officials were not available for comment. Bethlehem Steel, unable to turn its coke plant in Bethlehem, Pa., into a profitable operation, said it intends to close the plant by March 31. The nation's second-biggest steelmaker said it would try to sell the plant, which employs 800 workers, but that no buyers have emerged. Coke is used in making steel. Shaw Industries, a carpet manufacturer and retailing giant, said it plans to close 100 stores in a move affecting 600 employees. Shaw has about 24,000 employees. The Dalton, Ga.-based company said it would take a special fourth-quarter charge of 36.3 million -- roughly 17 cents a share, or 22.8 million after taxes -- to cover the costs.
For the past 15 years, one huge, looming menace has dominated American public policy the federal deficit Fear of the deficit has deterred Democrats from launching big new programs and Republicans from securing big new tax cuts. Now all that has changed. The deficit which only five years ago amounted to a record 290 biffion, has suddenly disappeared, and Washington is about to become a very different place possibly a more dangerous one. The deficit applied constraints that made major policy changes almost impossible. Incrementalism ruled, and thats been a good thing. As the growth of government has slowed, the growth of the private sector has accelerated, and the nation has become more prosperous. In a kind of ironic feedback loop, that prosperity has led to increased tax revenues, which have brought down the deficit and led us to 1998, the Year of the Surplus. And so, in this new Washington, for the the first time since the Vietnam War, theres money to spend. Potentially a lot of  money. The figures are astonishing but at . this point only dimly comprehended by a  public thats been bombarded fdr years  with deficit-fighting rhetoric, much of it phony.. Take a look. In fiscal year 1997, which ended on Sept 30, the budget deficit was just 23 billion. While the budget resolution for fiscal 1998 projected a deficit of 90 billion, the latest estimate of the Congressional Budget Office CBO is for a deficit of 57 billion.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30A vibrant economy and plentiful jobs boosted Americans' confidence in their financial situation to a 28-year high this month despite the volatile stock market, a New York business research group said today. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence jumped to 134.5 for December from a revised 128.1 in November. It was the highest reading since June 1969, when the index stood at 137.9. Consumers expect... favorable conditions to continue, and they're not picking up anything in the work force or in their communities or in business conditions that's signaling anything negative is in the works, said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Buard's Consumer Research Center. Nearly 41 percent of the 5,000 households surveyed rated jobs as plentiful' this month, up from 36.4 percent last month. In addition, fewer respondents said jobs had become more difficult to obtain. That positive sentiment lifted consumers appraisals of both their current situation and their expectations for the future, Franco said. The present-conditions index climbed to 161.7 from 156.8, while the expectations measure rose to
Ahh, holiday memories. Festive lights and tree trimmings. Hearty feasts. The spirit of giving. Shopping. Spending. Credit-card receipts. Mountains of debt. As happens every year, seasonal cheer went out with a bang on New Year's Day as many consumers sobered up to the reality of having spent more than they had intended to during the holidays. Indeed, overspending between Thanksgiving and New Year's has become so customary that even before the holidays, a Gallup Poll commissioned by Bank Rate Monitor newsletter, North Palm Beach, Fla., found consumers were expecting it would take five to six months to pay off their holiday credit-card bills. Grousing by retailers about lackluster sales suggests that many shoppers did exercise at least some restraint. But digging out from under the holiday bills may still be more painful than many consumers might think because of changes in the credit-card business.
One secessionist says succinctly Name another city that has a mountain range running through it. And geography is but one reason why the two-fifths of this city that sprawls north of the Santa Monica Mountains may try to do what 11 states attempted in the 1860s and 13 colonies did in 1776 declare independence. Tom McClintock, a state assemblyman, is to the San Fernando Valley's secession what John Calhoun was to the South's -- the most trenchant theorist The ultimate check on an abusive or dysfunctional government is the ability of people to walk away from it. When McClintock was a high school student in White Plains, N.Y., he came home one day to find his mother in tears over her taxes. Thus was made a young conservative and a California family The ability to walk away from a dysfunctional government is what brought my family out here. Now he is 41 and determined to midwife the birth of what would be the nation's sixth largest city. Los Angeles would drop to third, behind New York and Chicago, and ahead of Houston and Philadelphia. Sliced off of Los Angeles, the valley would be the nation's second most affluent city of more than one million. Today its per capita income is 19,021, second only to San Francisco's 19,695. In the rest of Los Angeles the figure is 14,668. The valley is 4 percent African American, 8 percent Asian American and has a large Latino population. Spanish is spoken in a quarter of all homes, and 38 percent of adults are foreign born. Los Angeles, McClintock says, grew like the old Soviet Union, by gobbling up contiguous communities, such as Hollywood and many others. It used its ownership of water rights to lure communities into an imperial city. The result is a city of 467 square miles, large enough to hold St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Boston and Pittsburgh, with room remaining for Manhattan. Another result, says McClintock, is a city where local government is not local.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation about breast-feeding duration has not changed so dramatically as was suggested by What's Good for the Baby May Guilt-Trip the Mother Second Opinion, December 9. Previously, they recommended breast-feed to one year currently, they say breast-feed to at least one year. They present a solid body of evidence supporting the vital importance of breast-feeding to women's and children's health, and its potential impact on health care costs, the environment, maternal job satisfaction and productivity. The column missed the forest the vast improvements in women's lives when this country becomes a truly breast-feeding society for the trees the temporary difficulties some women may face in the process. As a family physician who believes physicians have a responsibility to provide people with accurate and current data from which they can make informed health decisions, I believe that withholding vital information to spare people feelings of guilt or failure is patronizing at best, negligent at worst. Prospective parents need correct information about the crucial infant feeding decision. The AAP has provided it. Let's hope this gives parents the impetus to choose breast-feeding in a decidedly bottle-feeding culture. Alicia Dermet Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Family Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Old Bridge, N.J. Instead of criticizing the Academy of Pediatrics, you should be applauding them and supporting their efforts to educate not only their members but individual families and the business community in this country. Where is your article about the policy statement and what it actually says Where are your articles about how we as a society could begin to achieve this goal You could fill a column every week about breast-feeding and how mothers, whether working outside the home or not, are successfully breast-feeding their babies. You could do exposes about how hospitals and health care professionals often sabotage new mothers' efforts to breast-feed their babies. You could write about the many hospitals who do get new mothers off to a good start and employers who provide support to allow new mothers to breast-feed even though they work outside the home.
Bowater, the largest U.S. maker of newsprint, confirmed it is in talks to buy a stake in Halla Pulp & Paper's newsprint mill in Korea, as it seeks a low-priced investment amid economic turmoil in Asia. Halla's parent, Halla Group, was declared bankrupt by its creditors on Dec. 6 after it failed to repay 215 million of debt. Chrysler doesn't expect to increase the price of its cars and trucks in 1998 or 1999, continuing last year's trend of little or no price hikes. There's no opportunity for pricing in this market, Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Eaton said in an interview at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The only way you're going to maintain or increase your margins is through cutting costs. Investors closed out 1997 on a strong note as inflows into equity mutual funds were robust. Stock mutual funds took in 1.4 billion in new cash for the two days ending Dec. 31. That's up from inflows of 883 million for the prior two-day period ending Dec. 29. U.S. stock funds pulled in more than 1 billion in the period, with growth mutual funds getting the lion's share of the new cash at 483 million. The riskier aggressive growth funds attracted 389 million, while the more conservative growth and income funds netted 159 million. Spending on construction fell sharply in November but economists are predicting low interest rates will keep it from slipping much in 1998. The 0.9 percent decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 609 billion was the worst in 11 months, the Commerce Department said. An increase in spending on housing wasn't enough to offset a large decrease in nonresidential commercial construction and a small one in government building. Bethlehem Steel boosted its offer for Coatesville, Pa., steelmaker Lukens by 20 percent in a takeover battle for the nation's oldest continuously operated steel firm. The 30-a-share offer, with a total value of 740 million, tops an all-cash, unsolicited bid of 28 a share made Dec. 22 by Allegheny Teledyne, a Pittsburgh conglomerate.
PhyCor Inc. and MedPartners Inc. called off their proposed 6.25 billion merger, blaming significant operational and strategic differences. At the same time, MedPartners said it expects to take two large charges in the fourth quarter and possibly to report a quarterly loss from continuing operations. From the beginning, the planned combination of the two large physician management companies -- which stunned Wall Street when it was announced last October -- was greeted with skepticism by the Street. Almost immediately, the stock prices of both companies began to falter as analysts suggested that uniting the disparate cultures would be difficult. Yesterday, PhyCor, Nashville, Tenn., rose 12.5 cents to 26.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. MedPartners, Birmingham, Ala., fell 76.5625 cents to 18.1719 in composite Big Board trading. The merger plans were called off after the market closed. The merged company, which would have brought together the nation's two largest physician-management companies, would have had affiliations with about 35,000 doctors, or 5 of the country's physicians, and would have generated annual revenue of about 8 billion. Last fall, the companies heralded the deal as a way to put doctors on a level playing field with hospitals and health-maintenance organizations. Cost savings from economies of scale were also expected. Nevertheless, the differences proved insurmountable. Each company takes a much different approach to business in a number of key areas, including information systems, development, and operations, Joseph C. Hutts, PhyCor's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. In an interview, Mr. Hutts said the deal unraveled over about a week's time. He declined to specify the differences that led to the dissolution. He said the two companies agreed not to elaborate beyond the prepared statement. The differences were quite significant, Larry House, MedPartners chairman and CEO, said in an interview. He also declined to elaborate, saying only that the clashes involved the business operations and the corporate cultures.
A top official at the Japanese Finance Ministry met yesterday with officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, fueling speculation in global markets that Tokyo is seeking a multinational effort to brake a surge in the U.S. dollar that is threatening prospects for recovery in Asia's battered economies. In international currency markets yesterday, the dollar fell 3 yen from an earlier 5 12-year high of 134.25 yen per dollar as traders braced for the possibility that officials in the U.S. and Europe might join Japan in a coordinated effort to stem the dollar's rise by selling greenbacks. The yen stabilized in trading today in Tokyo, changing hands by late afternoon at 132.30 yen to the dollar, but there was no signal from Treasury that U.S. officials were contemplating market action. Many analysts and investors concluded that U.S. officials were insisting on bolder economic reforms from the Japanese government aimed at boosting growth in Japan, as the price of U.S. help in halting the dollar's climb. I have got to believe that the U.S. is saying, Yes, we can help, but that's only possible if you make some basic changes in your policies. Otherwise, we'd just be whistling in the wind,'  said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, who said Japanese officials have good reason to fear the prospect of their currency in free fall, much like those afflicting other Asian currencies. A standoff between the United States and Japan would be likely to exacerbate Asia's financial crisis, which took yet another turn for the worse yesterday as stock markets and currencies across the region declined sharply, led by a 6 percent plunge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index that was followed by another 5 percent fall in early trading today Story, Page C2.
For homeowners, these are the best of times. The economy has been expanding for 27 consecutive quarters. Over the past year, the stock market peaked and consumer confidence reached its highest level in 28 years. Mortgage interest and unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in decades. Real wages -- at least for the better-off -- are rising, and government coffers are overflowing. Even crime rates are down. So it is only natural that home sales are breaking records and prices are beating inflation. That's the conclusion of the latest Home Price Forecast, prepared for The Wall Street Journal by the economic research firm Case Shiller Weiss Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The forecast reflects actual price changes in 10 of the largest metropolitan areas from August 1996 to August 1997 and projects figures to January 1999. Not everyone feels like celebrating, however. In Chicago, where the economists predict the lowest price rises of the 10 metro areas, home prices are just keeping pace with inflation and houses are languishing on the market. I've lowered my price 10,000, and there still have been no offers, says retired publisher Frank Albergo, whose 2,000-square-foot, turreted Norman-style home has been on the market for more than a year. It is currently listed at 239,000. San Francisco, by contrast, is expected to remain the country's hottest and the most expensive housing market. Susan Sparks, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, expects a quick sale of her 2,046-square-foot tract home, recently listed for 205,000. She says 15 homes in her development have sold in the past six months, some for their full listing price in two weeks or less.
I'm 26 and met my boyfriend in 1994 through mutual friends. We began to see each other regularly, and the relationship developed into an intense one where we did a majority of our activities together. After two years we moved in together. The first few weeks were like a honeymoon, but his unemployment and some of the closeness we had developed was smothering both of us. We broke up and he moved out. We maintained some contact afterward, but each of us dated other people and sometimes talked with the other about struggles with those relationships. After nine months and two conversations about it we decided to give it another shot. We have entered couples' therapy, and have begun our new involvement at a slow and thoughtful pace with a pretty good understanding of the issues around which we clash. I am excited about the direction we are heading in, and wanted you to receive something from a Generation Xer who has her head on straight. -- H.A. I was with you till the couples' therapy part. Do you really want to be part of a pair that needs help with the dating phase Courtship is supposed to be a fun, carefree time spent getting to know someone to see if there is enough love and compatibility for a life commitment. Carefree because your mind is clearest before you become encumbered by kids, mortgages and other responsibilities to each other, and fun because it will be tough to weather a war if you don't enjoy each other at peace. Call it a trial period with appetizers. You guys, on the other hand, have not only analyzed fun onto the endangered species list, but you weathered your one crisis -- his unemployment, which in the early twenties isn't even that huge -- by busting up. I know you're proud of how things worked out by finding fault, I feel as if I just backed over your dog. But therapy should be a last resort, and then only for already-married couples who by definition have a pressing reason to make things work. You're 26 You're single You have years to find someone who clicks without professional intervention.
The School Board on Tuesday night approved a 186.4 million operating budget for fiscal 1999 -- an increase of more than 33 million over the 1998 spending plan -- then said the county supervisors have an obligation to adopt the budget in full. Board members acknowledged that the budget is a substantial increase, but they said growth, inflation and the stunting effects of the supervisors' past budget cuts, have made it necessary. School Superintendent Edgar B. Hatrick III has said that in the last eight years, the supervisors have given the schools 62.3 million less than requested. The Board of Supervisors could have funded every dollar of the School Board's approved budget within the eventually adopted tax rate and still produced a surplus, said School Board member Edward J. Kiley Mercer. Instead, they reduced it by 64 million and put us under the inflation curve. If that happens again this year, then some people in this county ought to be ashamed of themselves. The School Board made a few minor changes, involving teachers' salaries, to Hatrick's initial 185.5 million proposal, bumping up costs an additional 900,000. The board also approved a 214.9 million operating budget for fiscal 2000, 300,000 less than Hatrick's proposal.
With Asian financial markets in turmoil, Europe in an economic funk and the price of just about everything falling around the world, it seems everyone wants to have and hold dollars. In recent weeks, there have been reports of Russian housewives stuffing greenbacks into glass jars and secretaries in Singapore switching their savings accounts into dollars at local branches of Citicorp and American Express. Thai chambermaids have taken to pleading with hotel guests for tips in dollars, not baht. Big financial players have also jumped into the act. Treasurers of giant corporations are scrambling to convert overseas profits back into dollars before they erode further in value. And central bankers in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Australia and even Switzerland have been selling off gold reserves in favor of dollars and U.S. Treasury bonds. All this demand for greenbacks has driven up the value of the dollar against most other currencies. In the past six months, the dollar has risen 4 percent against the German mark, 15 percent against the Japanese yen, 70 percent against the Thai baht, 90 percent against the Korean won and 195 percent against the poor Indonesian rupiah. To a large degree, the dollar's ascent reflects flight from the economic problems in Asia to the relative safety offered by the U.S. economy and its financial markets. Were it not for the stabilizing influence provided by the dollar, economists say the damage from the crisis could have been even greater.
Stock-market indexes posted sharp declines in the final hour of trading yesterday, although traders and investors described the slide as the natural outcome of three straight days of gains. The market has just run out of steam for a little while, said Bob Basel, head of listed stock trading at Salomon Smith Barney. There's nothing worrying in what we're seeing here. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 92.92 points to 7691.77. Resilient technology stocks buoyed the Nasdaq Composite Index, which retreated only 1.70 points to 1547.06. The 7 decline in Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index overnight ensured that the trading day in North America began on a sour note. It also revived fears that even if U.S. companies with exposure to Asian markets post better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, they may not be as lucky in the first half of 1998. Indeed, Eastman Kodak reported stronger operating earnings for the fourth quarter, but warned of a slowdown in the first quarter, thanks to the strength in the U.S. dollar and growing competition. Buying by institutional investors such as mutual-fund managers, responsible for much of the 204.27-point advance in the Dow in the first three days of the week, was hard to spot yesterday, traders said.
Leaving a recent meeting with AT&T's new chief, C. Michael Armstrong, at the company's Basking Ridge, N.J., base of operations, cable magnate John Malone turned to an aide and said, I've met every AT&T chairman since 1964, and this is the first one that gets it. It appears Wall Street is feeling the same vibes. Since tapping Mr. Armstrong, the former chief executive of Hughes Electronics, to be its new chairman in October, AT&T has seen its stock price rocket 44, giving Ma Bell a stock-market value of 105 billion and a more valuable currency for doing deals. But what has Mr. Armstrong, a onetime senior executive of International Business Machines who pushed Hughes into the satellite-TV business, done to warrant all the investor enthusiasm Not much, at least not publicly. AT&T still faces the fight of its life in the coming year in everything from local-phone services to the Internet, which means its current stock runup may be short-lived. Some of the most prominent analysts who follow the stock are witholding their endorsements. Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney and Daniel Reingold of Merrill Lynch & Co. have set neutral and hold ratings, respectively. Under Mr. Armstrong, AT&T still faces the same challenges that sat like an elephant on its stock price under his predecessor, Robert E. Allen Jr.
Like People and Vogue, Outlaw Biker magazine provides ample photographic coverage of parties. Unlike People and Vogue, Outlaw Biker covers the kind of parties where the men ceremonially lynch Japanese motorcycles and the women exhibit their joie de vivre by stripping off their T-shirts and showing their breasts. Outlaw Biker is immature, antisocial, obscene and very funny. We keep it raunchy, righteous and real for ya, proclaims a house ad, which promises subscribers the wildest parties, the hottest bikes, the finest women, the dirtiest jokes. Outlaw Biker is the best of a genre of magazines that includes Biker, Easyriders, Iron Horse and others. These aren't motorcycle mags, they're biker mags. There's a big difference. Motorcycle magazines are about motorcycles -- their frames, their spark plugs, their airflow. Biker mags are lifestyle publications for men whose lifestyles revolve around fast bikes, loose women, baroque tattoos, knuckle-busting jobs, unemployment checks, probation officers, lots of beer and God knows what other mind-altering substances. Here's what the lifestyle of a biker is all about -- the fun, the broads, the bikes and the parties, proclaims the latest issue of Biker as it asks readers to send in photos of their bikes, their parties and their womenfolk. We're popping the rubber band off the bankroll and paying out 20 for every shot we use. These magazines are not for the squeamish or the politically correct. They're fun, though, if you're willing to take them in the spirit in which they're offered -- a spirit captured in their subtitles. Easyriders bills itself as Entertainment for Adult Bikers -- and rehab survivors. Biker says it's the publication For Dissenting Adults Only.
Why ask whether Prince William County residents would pay a higher tax if the money went directly to schools They voted down the car tax, of which a substantial portion goes to schools. It seems that the majority in this county are more concerned with their short-term financial well-being than with the long-term well-being of our children. Throwing money at the schools isn't going to solve any problems, anyway. The ineffectiveness of schools has very little to do with funding the problem is that the entire setup is heavily flawed. Children are not evolutionarily prepared for sitting long hours in desks while teachers try to impart knowledge upon them. What they mostly learn is how to give the teacher what she wants in order to make the grade. If, as so many experts say, children's education hinges on parental involvement, then the county should focus on encouraging that. The ultimate example of parental involvement in education is home schooling, which is proven to be highly effective for children with a wide variety of needs, interests and abilities. We should stop throwing money at the education problem and encourage greater parental involvement. SHIRLEE SEABORNE Woodbridge In a 1997 Washington Post survey, some 62 percent of all Prince William County residents said they would vote for a meals tax if the funds were dedicated to education.
MEXICO CITY -- Few observers expect the presence of a new governor at the Bank of Mexico to bring about a change in the central bank's monetary policy, to be released Monday. The policy outline will be the first for Governor Guillermo Ortiz, the former finance minister who took up the post Jan. 1 following the retirement of Miguel Mancera. As in 1997, the monetary policy in 1998 is expected to leave the peso floating freely against the U.S. dollar while keeping a lid on money supply to hold inflation to the government's budgeted goal of 12 for the year. We are leaning toward a tight policy to avoid a balance-of-payments imbalance, Javier Murcia, director of economics for Latin America at Credit Suisse First Boston said of his expectations. Mexican economic consultant Jonathan Heath also believes policy will vary little from 1997, with one difference. Hopefully, there will be a mention of a contingency program, on the assumption that the current-account deficit erodes more than expected, he said. The government has projected a current-account deficit of from 6 billion to 7 billion for 1997, based on an increase in imports as consumer demand recovers. The deficit stood at 4 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Marcus M. Griffith Sr., 73, a Hyattsville area manufacturer of hair-care products who was a member of the board of the National Association of Manufacturers and president of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, died of a heart attack Jan. 24 at Fort Washington Hospital. He lived in Fort Washington. Mr. Griffith was a graduate of American University. He had been a businessman in the Washington area since the 1950s, and his firm, The Hairlox Co., distributes products internationally. He was a native of British Guyana who came to the United States in 1949. He worked initially as a cosmetics company salesman in New York and then for Fuller Products in Chicago and Baltimore. He began his own company, Beauty Queen, in Washington in 1955 and expanded it into a chain of salons the next year. He also was founder of a consortium, Community Distributing Services, which serviced drugstores. Mr. Griffith was a founder and treasurer of the American Health and Beauty Aids Institute and a member of the D.C. Unemployment Compensation Board and its study commission, the Small Business Council of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Export Council and the membership committee of Jesse Jackson's Leadership Conference. In addition, he was a member of Calvary Episcopal Church in Washington
WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's proposal to use budget surpluses to salvage Social Security got a big boost yesterday as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan endorsed the plan. The prospect of a sustained budget surplus is a very useful platform to finally get to a point where the Social Security problem is something which is truly resolvable, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. That may not be the case a number of years from now, he warned, adding that it would be a real tragedy if we failed to employ this particular platform as the beginning of the solution to this problem. Meanwhile, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said yesterday that simply transferring projected federal surpluses into the Social Security Trust Fund, one of several options expected to come under consideration in the coming debate over reforming the retirement system, would delay the fund's depletion by 10 years. Offering a preview of administration budget estimates to be released next week, Mr. Summers said surpluses will be projected to be at least 1 trillion over the next 10 years. Every 100 billion transferred into the Social Security fund would extend its life by one year, he said. Though Mr. Greenspan has no direct role in the budget process, his tremendous credibility on Capitol Hill has made him an influential voice in such debates in recent years. His remarks were particularly striking in putting Social Security above tax cuts in his menu of priorities, placing him in conflict with many congressional Republicans who are pushing to return projected surpluses to taxpayers.
Fearful of what an Asian meltdown, the president's domestic problems or some other crisis may do to your 401k retirement fund Federal workers investing in the thrift savings plan can always retreat to one of the safest, most exclusive investment options the G-fund, guaranteed by Uncle Sam and not available to other investors. If this 25.2 billion federal puppy goes belly up, all of us feds and nonfeds alike will be battling at the nearest city dump for food and clothing. No matter what the stock or bond markets do, the G-fund never has a bad day. Its guaranteed rate of return is set monthly by the Treasury Department. So far it has outpaced inflation the goal of long-term investing, although it has not done as well as the higher-risk C-fund stock index. Money in the G-fund will be invested at 5.75 percent this month. Last month, the rate was 6.00 percent. In November and December, it was 6.125 percent.
WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing. Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997. The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2 last month from 8.9 a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9 last month, down from 2.1 a year earlier. The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them. The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7 of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to 12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors. In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week.
ASIA'S CURRENCIES have stabilized, and stock markets are bouncing back. The U.S. economy continues to roll, with 358,000 jobs created last month as wages rise, unemployment remains low and the Dow Jones average forges ahead. Maybe, a member of Congress might think, the Asian financial storm has blown past. Maybe we don't have to give the International Monetary Fund all those billions the Clinton administration is pressing for. If only it were so. Unfortunately, on many levels, it is too soon to relax. For millions of workers and their families in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and elsewhere, trouble is just beginning. Even if their nations' currencies and stock markets have bottomed out, the consequences of rising unemployment, slowed economic growth and declining standards of living have yet to unfold. To some extent, such consequences are unavoidable. But Americans have more than a humanitarian interest in mitigating Asia's pain. So far, the economic impact on the United States has been, if anything, beneficial, as Asia's crisis dampens inflationary pressure here. But in the coming months the impact is likely to be less positive, as competitive pressures threaten some American jobs. And if the economic crisis worsens and provokes ethnic riots in Indonesia and social instability elsewhere, the national security and economic impact on the United States could be adverse in the extreme. Moreover, the financial situation remains precarious. This is especially so in Indonesia, where the dictatorial President Suharto refuses to recognize the need for more democracy or to prepare the ground for a political transition. Democratic South Korea is in far better shape, thanks to the earnestness and skill with which President-elect Kim Dae Jung has devoted himself to far-reaching economic reform. But even South Korea remains vulnerable to shifts in fickle and sometimes irrational international financial flows. So do nations not yet infected, or barely infected, by the Asian contagion, from China to Hong Kong to Russia to Brazil. Any one of these developing nations, or all of them, could be tripped up by a congressional refusal to support the IMF. Critics attack the IMF, the international organization leading the financial rescues of Asia's economies, on two grounds. Some accept its importance but cite the mistakes it has made. It has made mistakes, and it does need to be more open in its functioning. But the reforms it's promoting this time around -- for less corruption and cronyism, greater openness, reliable unemployment insurance and more -- will promote democracy and social welfare if faithfully implemented.
The annual report of the president's Council of Economic Advisers released yesterday begins not with cautious assessment but a sweeping celebratory declaration The past year saw the nation's economy turn in its best performance in a generation. The report ticked off the now-familiar figures for strong economic growth -- the rapid rise in jobs, the drop in unemployment to a 24-year low and a decline in core inflation to the lowest level since the mid-1960s. The economy is remarkably free of the symptoms that often presage an economic downturn -- such as an increase in inflation, an accumulation of inventories or evidence of financial imbalance, the council members wrote in the report. Only in the administration's forecast for the next three years does the CEA turn cautiously conservative. Like many private-sector economists, those at the CEA believe that some special factors, such as the huge run-up in the stock market, helped push inflation-adjusted economic growth to 3.2 percent in 1996 and 3.9 percent last year. As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000. We have had an utterly exceptional rate of growth, which has reduced unemployment to a level at or below that regarded as full employment by many economists, CEA Chairman Janet L. Yellen told reporters. Our forecast is sufficient to keep the economy operating in that full-employment range.
Corrections The mortgage brokerage operated by Carrie and John Staples was incorrectly identified in a Feb. 14 article on refinancing in the Real Estate section. Published 022898 The recent crush of homeowners wanting to refinance their mortgages has left Carrie and John Staples, a husband-and-wife mortgage brokerage team, practically imprisoned in their Great Falls home-based office. Ever since interest rates began dipping last month to their lowest levels in a quarter century, the Stapleses have had to start working at 5 a.m. -- sometimes 4 a.m. when they're really behind -- and not stopping until 6 p.m. when hunger sets in. It's pretty ridiculous, said Carrie Staples, 53, between copying loan documents and returning a borrower's telephone call as a fax machine spewed out the latest interest rates offered by lenders. I'm going from person to person. We're backed up on phone calls and we're trying to catch up all the time, said John Staples, 53, still wearing the sweat pants he slept in the night before. It's getting pretty rough.
LONDON -- For investors looking abroad these days, the tune is Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Choose a money manager who can make the right stock pick. Performance data on international portfolio managers indicate that when investing outside the U.S., lately it has been more profitable to go with so-called active managers who are free to pick and choose among individual stock markets and stocks rather than merely mimic an overall index. Last year, U.S. pension funds that invest in foreign stocks posted a median 6.7 return, compared with a 1.9 total return price appreciation plus dividends paid for the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East EAFE index of 21 major overseas markets, according to InterSec Research Corp. of Stamford, Conn. Active managers have beaten the index in seven of the past 10 years, InterSec says. The trend held last year for mutual funds as well. The average return of 410 actively managed international mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services was 5.7. These results might make some investors sneer, compared with last year's 31 rise in the U.S. market, as measured by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the third consecutive year of outsize U.S. stock returns.
Institutional money managers are targeting the hedge-fund business as a fee-rich growth area that can also help retain promising talent. Leading the pack Alliance Capital Management LP, the money-management company whose family of hedge funds already has 1.3 billion under management -- and is gunning for 2 billion by year end. Hedge funds are private investment partnerships for qualified wealthy investors that often use borrowed funds to boost returns from bets on stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. Because hedge funds aren't subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, they offer the individual investor some investment choices he or she can't get in mutual funds, namely the option to profit from stock-market declines by selling borrowed shares short. For investment companies, though, hedge funds present the constant threat that carefully groomed talent will be drained away. The lure hedge funds' usual annual charge of 1 on assets under management, plus a 20 cut of gains for the top dog whether performance tops the benchmarks or not. In recent years, a weed patch of fresh hedge funds has sprouted as a result One estimate puts total assets in such funds at 370 billion, in 3,000 funds. This raises the question of who will manage the big money in the future, wrote Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, in a report published this week that cited those estimates.
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Officials of the International Monetary Fund here and in Washington held out hope of defusing a high-profile confrontation with President Suharto over the wisdom of adopting a currency board in Indonesia. IMF officials are now talking hopefully about an agreement in principle that would allow Mr. Suharto to save face by keeping the currency-board option alive but delaying implementation of it until banking-sector and debt issues can be addressed. That could take at least six months, a near-eternity in the current crisis. A currency board would take over the role of the central bank in strengthening Indonesia's currency, which has lost 73 of its value since last summer. Under a board, an approach used in Argentina and Hong Kong, a government pledges to buy its currency at a fixed rate against a designated foreign currency, in this case the U.S. dollar, and to hold enough foreign reserves to back all its currency in circulation. The IMF, the U.S. and other donor countries have argued strongly against a currency board for Indonesia, saying it would do more harm to the economy than good unless banking and other economic reforms were fully in place. It is important to show that the currency board is something we could work for together in the future, a senior IMF official here said Wednesday.
Builders broke ground on new houses at a slightly slower pace in January, the Commerce Department said this week, but permit applications for future construction hit an eight-year high, a sign of a vigorous housing sector. Total starts fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.534 million in January after a steeply revised 1 percent gain to 1.538 million in December, the department said. January was the fifth consecutive month in which starts exceeded the 1.5 million a year. The January housing starts data reveal that the combination of low interest rates and extraordinarily good weather have provided a strong vaccination for the housing sector from the effects of the Asian currency crisis, said economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. The January strength was concentrated in the single-family home market, where starts climbed 7 percent to an annual rate of 1.196 million -- the highest level since 1.231 million last February. That followed a 4.2 percent decline in December. Construction of apartments, by contrast, fell 19.5 percent last month to 338,000 after rising 18 percent in December.
Japan found itself uncomfortably in the spotlight today as top officials from the other industrialized countries declared that Tokyo had not done enough to stimulate its economy and help lift its Asian neighbors out of their economic crisis. Emerging from a daylong conference around the corner from Buckingham Palace, finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations said that additional tax cuts and public-works spending would be necessary for Japan to recover from its seven-year economic slump. The broadly shared view coming out of our meeting was that it was important for the rest of Asia that Japan once again have strong economic growth, said U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. But Tokyo's new finance minister, Hikaru Matsunaga, adopted a defiant stance following the meeting, where he told his Western counterparts that a recently announced package of financial reforms and limited tax cuts for businesses and investors had not been given a fair hearing nor sufficient time to work. I do think the measures that have been taken so far are not too small, said Matsunaga, who emphasized that his government has no plans to announce any further steps.
Most of the time, Hylda Perry can be found scurrying around the Columbia offices of Norwest Corp.'s trust division, troubleshooting the financial company's computer systems. But at least once a day, Perry sits down at her computer and dials up the Internet to check the price of Norwest stock. And Perry's interest in the stock of the Minneapolis-based company has spread to a new-found desire for information on the way markets operate. Since 1996, Perry and most of Norwest's other 57,000 employees have received options to buy Norwest shares. An option is the right to buy a share of stock at a preset price at a specified time in the future. If the market price of the stock rises above the price of exercising the option, the option holder pockets a profit. Norwest's share price quickly surpassed the 60 price of exercising the options -- giving Perry a chance to make a 2,700 profit -- but she isn't selling, because the stock is still hitting new highs. Also, Norwest granted another round of options last year, with a potential upside of more than 11,000. We can cash out or sell them off, but you don't have to do a thing, Perry said. I'm holding on to mine for a while, to make more money.
New York City, which has spent most of the past decade in the rating-agency doghouse, received a big boost as a major credit-rating company upgraded nearly 28 billion of city debt. The upgrade to A3 from Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. was certainly good news for scores of investors who own city debt, either through mutual funds or by holding individual bonds. Both the current rating and the old one are investment grade, but the one-notch upgrade could mean that more mutual funds and other institutional investors will buy city debt. Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been. Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus. Market analysts said that city debt prices were largely unchanged by the news, but could improve in the days and weeks to come as more investors decide to buy New York debt again. Like Moody's, Standard & Poor's is seeing the city in a different light, and officials there said they are considering an upgrade of city bonds after New York releases its new budget. Can investors sleep tight knowing the rating agencies are keeping close tabs on the city's fiscal health If you own city debt, you may want to study up on the last time bond raters said the city's finances were improving. In November 1987, Standard & Poor's upgraded city bonds just weeks after the stock market's crash the market's tailspin caused massive layoffs on Wall Street, a citywide recession and, eventually, lower bond prices. Market participants said S&P didn't anticipate then how seriously New York City would be hurt by the crash.
Since peaking in the second term of Ronald Reagan's presidency, spending on weapons by the Pentagon has been on a steady decline. In real terms, adjusted for inflation, spending on production of planes, ships, tanks and ammunition has fallen 70 percent since 1985. This year, though, the Clinton administration is trying to reverse that slide, asking Congress in the president's recently released budget for the first real increase in defense procurement in 13 years. As the chart at the right shows, this reversal comes as the overall defense budget -- which includes spending for operations, maintenance and personnel in addition to weaponry -- is barely rising. When adjusted for inflation, it actually shows a 1 percent decline. It's certainly fair to say the deep cuts in procurement over the past 10 years are over, said Steven M. Kosiak, budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. President Clinton's budget seeks 48.7 billion for new weaponry in fiscal 1999, up nearly 9 percent from 44.8 billion in the current year's budget. By 2000, the plan calls for 54.1 billion in procurement spending, and the number rises to 63.5 billion by 2003. The spending shift can be attributed to the need to modernize many of the military's older weapons as well as the administration's desire to begin production of some 21st-century programs.
NEW YORK -- Bouts of selling drove the bond market moderately lower, but not out of its recent trading range. Remarks this week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had a lingering effect, as investors grapple with uncertain prospects for U.S. growth and monetary policy. People love to sell markets when that happens, said Dennis Hynes, managing director at R.W. Pressprich & Co. However, there's been no real damage to the market, he added. In yesterday's trading, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 1532 point, or 4.6875, for each 1,000 in face value, to 102 1032. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.948 from 5.915. Treasurys traded lower early in the session as a decline in bond futures pulled the entire Treasurys market lower. Although prices recovered somewhat by afternoon, they never climbed into positive territory. Traders said Treasurys later faced pressure as Cummins Engine Co. sold a 765 million offering. Large new corporatedebt issues can affect Treasurys for various reasons among them, underwriters of corporate issues often sell Treasurys to hedge against broad market declines during the underwriting process.
Japan has given a clear response to U.S. demands that it stimulate its domestic economy yes, no, maybe so. Take today, for example. First came the news reports this morning that the Japanese government was considering tax cuts. Then, later in the day, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto backtracked slightly, ambiguously urging caution on the tax cut issue. Japan's chief government spokesman, Kanezo Muraoka, also spoke up, saying Japan would pursue both economic stimulus and fiscal reform. Most economists say that these goals are contradictory. The government will have to spend money to stimulate Japan's economy quickly, but is also planning to cut spending to meet fiscal reform goals. Today's mixed signals are just the latest in a litany of vague and often contradictory statements about economic programs made by Japanese officials since last weekend's Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in London, where Japan was pressured to boost its economy. For example, some officials are vigorously trying to jawbone stock prices higher, setting a target of 18,000 on the Nikkei 225-stock index by March 31. The date is important because that's the end of Japanese banks' fiscal years, and they may have to report dramatically lower values on their stock market holdings if prices don't rise.
OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose 3.8 in 1997, led by strong exports to the U.S. and a big increase in business spending on machinery and equipment, said Statistics Canada, a government agency. Last year was the sixth consecutive year to show a rise in Canada's GDP, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services. The 1997 result almost matched last year's U.S. GDP growth of 3.9. Canada's robust expansion is expected to continue. In a recent survey of economists, the average forecast was for 3.5 Canadian GDP growth in 1998 and 2.9 in 1999. Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in a speech yesterday, said low interest rates, improved consumer and business confidence and booming exports have revived the Canadian economy. He also hailed a federal budget projection that in the current fiscal year ending March 31, the Canadian government will show its first balanced budget in almost 30 years. Mr. Chretien is expected to underscore his country's fiscal and economic achievements in a luncheon speech today to the Economic Club of New York. Canada's latest economic indicators were well received on financial markets. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-share composite index closed up 20.61 points, or 0.3, at 7113.10 yesterday. The Canadian dollar rose to 70.51 U.S. cents from 70.23 U.S. cents Friday.

MERRIMACK, N.H. -- Unitrode Corp. said it agreed to acquire Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc. of Dallas in a deal valued at about 145.5 million at yesterday's share price in a merger of two makers of specialized semiconductors. Under terms of the agreement, Unitrode will exchange one share for each of Benchmarq's eight million shares outstanding. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Benchmarq shares rose 87.5 cents to 17.125. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Unitrode stock fell 62.5 cents to 18.1875. Terms of the deal will be adjusted if Unitrode shares fall below 16 or rise above 24, and not more than 1.33 million Unitrode shares will be issued as part of the deal, subject to approval by holders of each company's stock. Unitrode specializes in semiconductors that manage power use in computers. Benchmarq's specialty is battery-management systems that lets users gauge remaining power in their portable computers and cellular phones. Robert J. Richardson, president and chief executive officer of Unitrode, will become chairman and CEO of the combined companies. Alan R. Schuele, president and CEO of Benchmarq, will become president and chief operating officer.

An alarmist consensus is emerging among economic forecasters and commentators that the U.S. trade deficit in 1998 and 1999 will soar, surge and reach extreme levels. Prudent observers should treat this consensus, like others arrived at by economic forecasters, with a healthy degree of skepticism. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson once noted, Economists have correctly predicted nine of the last five recessions. In the present case, even if the forecast of a soaring U.S. trade deficit were closer to the mark than it is likely to be, its limited significance would not warrant the alarm that commentators are sounding. The reason is that the trade deficit is one of the least significant indicators of the economy's vitality and health as Walter Wriston and I explained on this page last June 19. In any event, the consensus view that the trade deficit -- to be more precise, the current-account deficit, which measures the excess of payments for imports of goods and services including capital services over earnings from the corresponding exports -- will soar is based on several seemingly persuasive arguments. First, U.S. markets will experience a flood of cheap exports from Asia following the depreciation of many Asian currencies by more than 50 in the past year, and of the Japanese yen by more than 25 in the past two years. Second, so the argument runs, U.S. exports to Asia, which represented about 25 of global U.S. exports, will decline sharply for a number of reasons stemming from Asia's financial turmoil the severe setback to economic growth in Korea and Southeast Asia continued stagnation in Japan the appreciated U.S. dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive to foreign buyers the depleted holdings of dollar assets in the Asian countries apart from Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and the austerity imposed on the Asian countries by the International Monetary Fund.
Corrections & Amplifications A TABLE accompanying an article on Friday's Home Front page incorrectly referred to the time frame for data on home appreciation. The correct time frame is the period from the first quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1997. In that period, home values in Modesto, Calif., rose 1.8, while home values rose 2.2 in Stockton, Calif., and 2.5 in Vallejo, Calif. The table incorrectly stated that home values in those areas fell last year. WSJ March 9, 1998 This may seem like a flashback, but it isn't. Burt Reynolds is a movie star again. Your friends are wearing Lacoste. And your home is showing significant appreciation. Home values rose 4.9 in 1997, well above the nation's average inflation rate of 1.7, according to an index that tracks repeat home sales compiled by mortgage buyers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That means U.S. home prices have climbed faster than inflation for three straight years. The country hasn't seen such good news on the housing front since the late 1980s. Perhaps the biggest surprise in the index was the gain posted by Flint, Mich., a gritty factory town of about 430,000 whose economic woes were chronicled in the quirky 1989 documentary Roger & Me. With auto makers hiring again, Flint's housing prices jumped 25 last year. The median home price in Flint was 102,845, up 64 from 1990.
The District government has made such a dramatic financial turnaround that city officials are considering a tax cut and projecting hundreds of millions of dollars of budget surpluses for the next five years. After years of deficits, the upbeat projections indicate that the city's recently announced 185.9 million surplus for 1997 was not a one-time achievement. Instead, it marked a turning point in the city's rebound from the depths of a financial crisis that may enable local leaders to cut taxes, officials said. D.C. financial control board Chairman Andrew F. Brimmer said the city's finances have improved so substantially that both residents and businesses may get a tax cut later this year. Rather than amassing large surpluses and having money in the bank, Brimmer said, part of the surpluses could be used to fund a tax reduction that would make the city a more attractive place to live and work. Brimmer said the details of a tax cut would have to be determined through serious discussions involving the D.C. Council and Mayor Marion Barry, who also has said he favors cutting taxes. The taxpayers in the District ought to look forward to a tax reduction, Brimmer said. The capacity is there.
Transportation companies are jacking up prices for the first time in a decade as the strong economy is filling trucks, ships and trains with more goods than they can handle. Shipping companies have notified corporate customers that freight -- moving charges this year -- which total about 450 billion annually -- will rise between 5 and 10 for some cargoes. Costs for package-hauling are also creeping upward. The U.S. Postal Service hopes to raise rates on its Priority Mail expedited service this year to 3.20 for a letter from 3.00, twice as big an increase as its last price boost in 1995. And giant United Parcel Service of America Inc. brought its commercial ground-transportation prices up 3.6 last month, partially to pay for its hefty new labor settlement with the Teamsters. Already, a wide range of shippers, from chemical concerns to farmers, are noticing the shift. The drugstore giant Walgreen Co. says trucking companies just told it about a planned 5 rate hike, no small sum for a company that spends about 100 million a year on trucking. You do your best in bargaining them down, says Tom Stedman, director of corporate transportation. The price increases are coming at a time when overall inflation in the U.S. has been tame. The consumer price index, the nation's broadest measure of consumer price inflation, rose just 1.7 in 1997. And with commodity prices falling and inexpensive imports flooding into the country because of Asia's currency crisis, few economists believe rising transportation costs are enough to re-ignite inflation. But if those deflationary extras disappear, economists see cause for concern. At the very least, they say, corporate profits could suffer.
Southern Californians seem happier than ever these days, and it has nothing to do with the bright sunshine that has replaced this winter's miserable rains. It is even more important than that They can fill their beloved cars with gasoline for under 1 a gallon. The same is true across the country, including the Washington area, where motorists are pulling up to the pumps and happily rediscovering the good old days as the price of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, is selling for less than the long-forgotten 25 cents a gallon it used to fetch in the early 1960s. But here in the biggest gasoline market in the nation, with notoriously long commutes over a vast freeway network, cheaper gasoline is particularly good news. I haven't seen these prices since cigarettes were 98 cents a pack, exulted Marcus Ware. Ware, 30, commutes 150 miles a day round trip from the inland desert suburb of Lancaster to his job at a credit card company here. He figures the weekly gasoline bill for his two cars has dropped from 150 to 85. Coley Sohn, a 28-year-old professional dog walker from Venice, said My friends make fun of me, but I really get excited when I see 91 cents a gallon. I feel like I have to pull over and fill up. I'm very superstitious, so I feel like if the gas prices are good, then everything will be good. And Nels Israelson, 39, an ecologically conscious photographer who regularly escapes to his cabin near Mount Baldy, in San Bernardino County, was filling up his mud-splattered Land Rover while complaining what lower gasoline prices might mean for the environment.
As Washington policymakers fret over the worsening economic crisis in Indonesia and new signs appear that President Suharto may be ready to jettison an international rescue package, the Clinton administration is preparing to host a more low-key Southeast Asian leader whose quiet style and determined commitment to reform have won him widespread popularity at home and plaudits abroad. When Thailand turned to Chuan Leekpai to take over the premiership last November, the country was the epicenter of the Asian economic meltdown. Its currency, the baht, was in free fall, the stock market was plummeting, the banking and finance system was a shambles and a hapless government gave the widespread impression that Thailand was in a collective state of denial, unable or unwilling to institute a badly needed but painful restructuring of the economy. In just four months, Chuan and his widely respected team of economic technocrats have turned that perception around. He bluntly warns of even tougher times ahead, but he is unwavering in his public determination to implement the stringent reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund. As a result, Chuan is riding an unprecedented wave of popularity, with a 73 percent approval rating, according to one recent survey. And that, in turn, has helped boost the confidence of Thailand's foreign bankers and investors. The thing that we love is the consistency factor, said Douglas M. Logan, managing director of CitiCapital Ltd., the investment arm of Citicorp. There's not a lot of flip-flopping on policy. He said, We will follow the IMF reforms,' and they've done that.
President Clinton and his allies in Congress are calling for another increase in the minimum wage. But they should consider the experience of small-business owners like me, who struggled through the last increase. I own and manage a small cafe. I have had as many as 16 employees I now have nine. Most of them are teenagers the rest, working mothers. Before the last increase I wrote letters to the president and my congressmen. I explained that the mandated wage increase was only the tip of the iceberg. To maintain the wage increment for senior employees, I would have to raise their wages above the new minimum. My monthly payroll would increase by 570 -- and that didn't include the payroll taxes for Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and workman's compensation. For my efforts I received nicely worded form letters about the benefits of the wage increase. When the increase passed, I had to reduce staffing hours. Result I am working harder to earn my money. I already worked six days a week, every week. The staffing cutbacks increased my workload by 15 hours a week. I also cut back on outside services, so I am now mopping my own floors two weeks each month and doing all my own accounting, the weekly laundry and as many of the repairs as I can. When Mr. Clinton signed the wage increase into law, he had by his side a minimum-wage worker who stated that now she did not have to choose between paying her electric bill or her gas bill. The same evening, our local news interviewed a woman who said she would now be able to buy her daughter a compact disk player for graduation. I do not begrudge either of these women their good fortune. But business owners work hard too, and we also have to make tough choices. I suffer from several chronic illnesses, and the wage increase has forced me to cut back on medical care. Money for minimum wage increases has to come from somewhere. Mr. Clinton's proposed increase would raise my annual payroll by 7,200, forcing me to close my doors. To the politicians I say this You have the power to destroy the American Dream for thousands of small-business owners. If you pass another increase in the minimum wage, you can tell the teenagers and working mothers I employ why they no longer have jobs. Then try asking for their votes.
Computer Learning Centers Inc., the Fairfax-based computer and networking training company, said yesterday that strong enrollment increases boosted earnings more than 50 percent in its latest fiscal year. The news sent the company's stock price up after several days of declines. The company reported that earnings rose to 9.6 million 56 cents a share on a diluted basis in its 1998 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, compared with 5.6 million 37 cents in fiscal 1997. The earnings report, which had been anticipated by market analysts, helped lift CLC's stock price to 21.71 78 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, up 1.98-716. The gain followed a two-day sell-off by investors and speculators at the beginning of the week that slashed the company's share price by 46 percent. Traders began dumping CLC stock Tuesday after the Illinois attorney general announced a lawsuit alleging that CLC misrepresented course offerings and employment prospects to students in its Schaumburg, Ill., school -- one of 25 it operates across the country. The company has denied the allegations. Analysts who follow the company said the strong earnings report does not foreshadow a big rebound in the company's stock price because of the lingering concerns raised by the Illinois investigation.
The planned takeover by the National Association of Securities Dealers of the American Stock Exchange has its roots in failed merger talks held last summer, according to industry and other sources familiar with the talks. Only after NASD Chairman Frank Zarb and Amex Chairman Richard Syron gave up on an overly ambitious attempt to combine the two markets did the veteran Wall Street executives find a more successful path -- to maintain the Amex as a separate exchange from the Nasdaq Stock Market, the sources said. Under the current proposal, hatched during a chance meeting at an industry function in November in Boca Raton, Fla., the Amex would live on as a separate subsidiary, and companies would choose whether to list their shares on the Amex or the Nasdaq. The initial collapse and subsequent revival of the negotiations between Zarb and Syron demonstrates the importance of the deal to both men and the securities markets they run. Zarb realized he needed a merger to better mount a global challenge to the mighty New York Stock Exchange, the biggest and most prestigious in the world. Syron decided that the Amex was not a viable market for the 21st century.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, splitting with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, said he backs a financial-services bill being pushed by the Republican leadership in the House. Mr. Greenspan's endorsement, expressed in a letter to House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach R., Iowa, came one day after a top Treasury Department official criticized the bill as a backward step for the banking industry. The Fed chief, however, said passage of the bill would be an historic achievement that would update the increasingly antiquated laws that constrain the development and competitiveness of our financial system. Mr. Greenspan said the bill would remove obsolete barriers that prevent banks, securities and insurance companies from merging. The bill would require any bank that affiliates with other firms to do so within a holding company, over which the Fed would have regulatory authority. The Treasury Department believes that a national bank should be able to conduct any new securities and insurance activities through an affiliate of the bank itself. That corporate structure falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department. In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich R., Ga. released earlier this week, Mr. Rubin said flatly that we oppose this bill and would not recommend its enactment.
Reading recent congressional testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, I had a scary thought He doesn't know any more than I do. By this, I don't mean to compare myself with Greenspan. He's forgotten more about the economy than I'll ever know. Beyond that, the Fed has a staff of 228 economists and is constantly briefed by companies, banks and governments about individual markets and industries. What's sobering is that despite these advantages, Greenspan still seems genuinely baffled by the economy's dazzling performance and its future direction. Precisely. The old adage now seems to apply If you're not confused, you don't understand the situation. On the one hand, the U.S. economy is booming beyond belief. In the past year it has created 3.1 million jobs the unemployment rate 4.6 percent in February hasn't been lower since March 1970. Measured inflation is declining. In the past year the consumer price index has risen only 1.6 percent. Consumer optimism is at lofty heights the Conference Board's confidence index touched 138 in February 1985 equals 100, a level not seen since the late 1960s. On the other hand, the news from Asia isn't getting better. China's economy is slowing Japan may slip into a recession a drop in output. Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund are in a virtual state of war. Including China and India, Asia represents about 30 percent of the world economy. Yet its troubles haven't spoiled American spending or spirits. One explanation is that the benefits of the crisis have come before the costs. The biggest benefit has been lower interest rates, which have triggered a surge in mortgage refinancings. Frightened by Asia's problems, global investors shifted funds into U.S. bonds and mortgage securities. Bond prices rose interest rates dropped. Investors accepted lower interest rates in exchange for more safety. In early 1997, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged almost 8 percent in 1998 they've hovered around 7 percent. Economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates the resulting explosion of mortgage refinancings will total about 400 billion in 1998. On a 120,000 loan, someone going from 8 percent to 7 percent would save nearly 1,000 a year. Lower rates have also sustained a high level of home buying and selling. For 1998, Lereah expects 4.24 million existing homes to be sold, a record. Americans are moving into more appealing homes and, in the process, doing a lot of redecorating and renovating. The second big benefit from Asia has been the plunge in oil prices. Since early 1997 they've dropped from 25 a barrel to 15. The United States now consumes 6.8 billion barrels of oil a year, says economist Michael Canes of the American Petroleum Institute. At the lower prices, consumers would save almost 70 billion. Average gasoline prices have dropped to about 1 a gallon from 1.20 a year ago they could go lower. Part of the gain is a wealth transfer from U.S. oil producers to U.S. consumers, but the gain on our imports -- half our oil use -- is pure windfall. Asia's crisis has cut demand, and the cartel OPEC is falling apart, Canes says. Countries violate their OPEC quotas. Supply rises, demand softens prices fall.
Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act passed two decades ago, the Federal Reserve is required to set targets for growth of the nation's money supply and explain twice yearly to Congress whether it has hit the targets, and if not, why not. In a time of high and rising inflation in the late 1970s, the hope was that the Fed would squeeze money growth, and in the process squeeze out inflation. That's because monetarist economists believed there are strong links between growth of the money supply and growth in the nation's gross domestic product. For a number of years beginning in 1979, the Fed focused tightly on money as it sought to reduce inflation. But then the links between money and current-dollar GDP became highly uncertain in the wake of sweeping changes in U.S. financial markets. As a result, the Fed now announces benchmark ranges for money growth rather than targets, and focuses on controlling overnight interest rates to stabilize the economy. The Shadow Open Market Committee, peopled by monetarists, this week complained the central bank ought to pay more attention to money growth, and warned that if it isn't curbed by interest rate increases there will be a resurgence of inflation. The chart at the right shows part of what the Shadow group is worried about The measure of money known as M2 grew faster last year than the 1 percent to 5 percent range established at the start of the year. The Fed set a similar range for this year, and so far M2 has increased so rapidly as to stay above the upper limit.
BUENOS AIRES -- Last year, television viewers here saw an extraordinary commercial. It had close-ups of rear ends and toilet seats. Ariel, Ariel, Ariel, an announcer chanted. Procter & Gamble Co. was mortified. For more than a year, it had been preparing to launch its Ariel laundry detergent in Argentina. Suddenly, an ad was telling all Buenos Aires that Ariel' is synonymous with toilet seats. The spots were advertising an obscure toilet-seat maker, Ariel del Plata SA, which, P&G learned, has ties to its big rival, Unilever Group. Locked in a global brawl with the AngloDutch conglomerate, P&G is convinced that the ad campaign was a calculated smear. But P&G's response was out-of-character The mighty multinational complained to regulators. In fact, P&G is becoming the biggest corporate whistle-blower south of the border. A latecomer to Latin America, the consumer-goods giant is scrawny in the region and is using a blossoming antitrust climate to help it catch up by filing lawsuits and snitching to antitrust cops. Although businesses around the world routinely seek to gain advantage over competitors by appealing to regulators, the scope and intensity of P&G's efforts to use Latin America's regulatory system to improve its competitive status are extraordinary. The maker of Tide, Crest and Pampers employs more than two dozen lawyers in Latin America, with fully one-third of their time devoted to exposing practices it considers prejudicial. It has systematically collected regulatory rulings from mature markets in the U.S. and Europe and turned them over as suggested precedents to guide Latin American regulators trying to interpret newly enacted antitrust laws. It also has funneled reams of data to trustbusters to show how competitors' practices might harm consumers. It is very, very insistent, says Manuel Sandoval, an official of Mexico's Federal Commission on Competition. Even their chairman of the board came to visit us.
The Asian financial crisis began to exert a serious drag on U.S. exports in January, according to a Commerce Department report issued yesterday. The lower exports helped drive the United States' trade deficit for that month to a record 12 billion. The downturn in sales of American goods to Asia, which economists have anticipated ever since the region's financial markets collapsed last fall, has manifested itself up to now mainly in anecdotes about individual U.S. firms losing business. But with yesterday's report it's undeniable that the effect of the crisis is in the data, said David Hensley, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. Hensley cited exports to South Korea, which plunged to 1.096 billion in January from 1.680 billion the previous month. The level is all the way down to 1993 levels, so we've essentially given back in a few months about four years of export growth, he said. Commerce Secretary William Daley agreed with that diagnosis, saying the crisis has taken its toll on our exports. Excluding Japan and China, sales of U.S. goods in Pacific Rim countries fell about 10 percent, Daley noted, while imports from those countries rose about 7 percent, apparently because of rising demand for goods that have become cheaper due to falling Asian currencies.
Feast or famine. That's the way it is when investors seek information on small-capitalization stocks. Usually there is nothing but company-produced legal documents, often not enough to form a full, solid opinion about a small company. But occasionally, when ardent fans come head-to-head with short sellers seeking to profit when a highflier plummets, there can be information overload. That's the case with Actrade International, a New York-based export and financial-services company. Actrade shares have taken a wild ride in the past year on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The price surged to a 52-week intraday high of 30 on Nov. 28, dropping, after two brief rallies, to a recent low of 10 12. It has since rebounded to nearly 15 intraday, closing Friday down 38 at 12 58. Volume has at times hit more than one million shares a day -- all without a single analyst at a major brokerage firm covering the stock. Actrade's activity stems from a crossfire of views on the company's prospects, most of which have been expressed in thousands of messages posted on the Internet. Actrade demonstrates vividly how the World Wide Web increasingly is being used to help -- and confuse -- investors. As the stock has moved strongly up and down, on-line bulls and bears have responded by posting a wide array of fact, exaggeration, and fiction. Bulls, many of whom got attracted to the stock's strong earnings growth and coverage in publications like Individual Investor magazine, have predicted untempered growth rates or a buyout of Actrade.
Emboldened by a strong economy, local and state lawmakers in Maryland have been setting aside money for extra school funding and other popular programs. They also are laying the groundwork for a less popular cause politicians' pay raises. The pay increases are set to go into effect after the November elections, when political analysts expect large numbers of incumbents to be returned to office. In some cases, the salary bumps are scheduled to exceed the projected 2.3 percent annual rate of inflation. In recent weeks, the Howard and Anne Arundel county councils have approved raises for top elected officials, of 10 to 20 percent over the next four years. Bills to raise commissioners' pay in three Southern Maryland counties by as much as 20 percent are pending in the General Assembly. The Montgomery County Council, which along with the Prince George's County Council receives annual cost-of-living raises even during recessions, is mulling whether to appoint a salary review commission to examine pay scales further. At the state level, lawmakers in Annapolis will not have to vote on legislation that would push their salaries to more than 30,000 a year for the first time. The bill will pass automatically unless members vote to reject it, meaning there would be no record of a vote for raises that could be used against lawmakers in November. Lawmakers offer a range of explanations for the increases. In several jurisdictions, some say, local elected officials are trying to compensate for the lack of any raise for almost eight years. Others point out that serving in a part-time legislature makes it difficult for many members to pursue private business interests that could supplement the salaries.
Surging supply and static demand usually don't bode well for bond prices. So why are many analysts pounding the table for muni bonds Falling interest rates and the economy's impressive growth have cleared the way for a torrent of new municipal bonds in the past year. Through Monday, 59.3 billion of new muni bonds were sold this year, up 62 from the 36.7 billion peddled during the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co. The amounts exclude securities maturing in less than one year. Issuance last year was 221.4 billion, up from 185 billion in 1996. Both new issues and refundings of previous deals have climbed, and volume should top 240 billion this year. In short, the supply has been massive, says George Friedlander, Salomon Smith Barney's municipal-bond strategist. Meanwhile, the inexorable climb of the stock market and super-slim bond yields have reduced demand from individual investors for muni bonds despite their tax-free status. Although interest has picked up in recent weeks, prices of muni bonds remain low compared with comparable Treasury issues. Munis have certainly done lousy this month, though short- and intermediatebonds have held up OK, says William Stevens of Montgomery Asset Management. Still, many market participants say munis could represent the best bargains in the bond market. They say new bond issuance should begin to slow in the coming months, due to limitations on how many times issuers can replace outstanding bonds with new bonds. New bond issuance also should slow because many issuers have already come to market in recent months and won't be back again for some time.
Addressing a meeting of University of Virginia administrators, students and faculty members, professor W. Dean Harman conceded today that he isn't sure how to grade his students. But knowing that many professors at other colleges aren't so picky about awarding A's, Harman said, he feels inclined to relax his own standards. Otherwise, his students would be at a disadvantage when they compete with undergraduates from other colleges for admission to graduate school, he said. I feel pressure to inflate grades so students aren't punished for taking a challenging course, Harman said. His comments were part of a university forum on grade inflation, an issue that universities across the country are trying to address. The meeting, attended by about 50 people, was organized by the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Melvyn P. Leffler, who said he wanted to give professors and students an outlet to discuss the problem candidly. U-Va. and many other universities say that students' grades keep rising. At U-Va., the grade-point average for all undergraduates is now 3.18, compared with 3.09 in 1989.
Lately, readers have been asking whether it's time to sell. No wonder they're worried. From Jan. 12 to March 24, a space of just 12 weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 17 percent. For the year, Pfizer Inc. is up 28 percent Ford Motor Co., 31 percent Fidelity Select Telecommunications Fund, 29 percent. Why not simply take a breather You're not greedy. With the market this high, it's bound to fall and you can buy back later, right Wrong. There may be reasons occasionally to sell stocks, but the overvaluation of the stock market -- alleged or actual -- is not one of them. I'll get to the right reasons for selling below, but first a tougher question than whether to sell whether to buy. . . . The date was May 28, 1995. The place was this very column. With the market up 20 percent in the past 12 months and acting giddy at such a high altitude, we asked if this might not be a good time to wait -- rather than purchase more shares of stock. Our suggestion Buy. At the time the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 4369. Since then, with dividends included, it has returned 112 percent.
NEW YORK -- A big drop in interest rates triggered a wave of corporate bond refinancings that powered Wall Street investment banks to a record quarter of stock and bond sales. But disclosed fees, or the money that Wall Street investment banks earn from underwriting new stocks and bonds, fell far short of a record, largely because the bulk of the quarter's financings were bond issues that typically reap far slimmer fees than stock offerings. The volume of domestic stock and bond financings jumped 63 to 472.7 billion during the first quarter, up from 290.7 billion in the same period last year, smashing the previous record of 372.5 billion set in last year's third quarter, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J. concern that tracks corporate-finance activity. If Wall Street investment banks keep up the breakneck pace, total stock and bond volumes could approach the 2 trillion mark this year, far eclipsing the record of 1.3 trillion underwritten in 1997. It's been raining deals all quarter, said Mark Seigel, head of global debt syndicate at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., one of Wall Street's biggest underwriters. Our new-issue desk has felt like a war zone. Behind the first-quarter boom was falling interest rates and a flight to quality precipitated by the Asian stock sell-off.
The Washington area's high-stepping economy could conceivably be tripped up in a variety of ways -- a stock market slide, a new Persian Gulf crisis, Asia's financial flu. That one could do it, if evidence of dangerous deterioration in the 36-year-old I-95 drawbridge between Alexandria and Prince George's County forces engineers to close it to truck traffic before a replacement has been built. More than a conduit for commuters and interstate 18-wheelers, the Wilson Bridge is a critical link between the region's primary storehouses -- the warehouse and shipping complexes around Springfield and Landover. As House and Senate members struggle over whether to fund a new bridge in the mammoth national transportation bill they are drafting, it's worth a look at the consequences of life in a temporarily Wilson-less world. The first shock would be impassable commuting gridlock, said David Keever, a consultant on the new Wilson Bridge project. On the opposite side of the city, the American Legion Memorial Bridge over the Potomac between Montgomery and Fairfax counties would look like a heart attack victim if many of the 175,000 cars and trucks that now use the Wilson Bridge daily go the other way around the Beltway instead. The American Legion bridge already sags with more than 200,000 vehicle crossings daily.
It seems that Fortune 500 executives are poor students of history. Have they ever heard liberte, egalite, fraternite They must be begging for guillotine. Leave the CEOs alone They work hard to get where they are, they deserve the high salaries. They work long hours, are away from home many nights, travel a lot. Put up with a lot of unhappy, unskilled and unappreciative people. No raise for us little guys for three years and the management all got bonuses and 15 raises. Do you think they will still get the same quality work from the lower ranks It is time for the management to give respect and thanks to the ones that work for them. I'm still mad today at AT&T, and have been considering different ways of reprisal for some time. It's time for an Economic Injustice' tax. Since it is the shareholders that reward CEOs for layoffs, I think the remedy is to tax shareholders a flat fee per share every time a company lays off a certain percentage of its labor force. There should also be levies for outsourcing, and moving jobs offshore. I noticed you didn't mention what any of the mucky-mucks at the AFL-CIO pay themselves.
South Korea's efforts to engineer an economic recovery received a shot in the arm yesterday when global investors turned out in droves to participate in the country's landmark 4 billion bond sale. In addition to paving the way for more South Korean corporate bonds, the sale is expected to set the stage for billions of dollars in Asian bonds in the months ahead. Searching for high-yielding bonds in an age of near-record-low bond yields, investors from around the globe showed strong demand for yesterday's two-part deal. Seoul sold 1 billion of five-year notes at a yield of 8.953, or 3.45 percentage points above comparable U.S. Treasurys. Some 3 billion of 10-year securities were sold at a yield of 9.084, or 3.55 percentage points above Treasurys. Seoul was able to sell the bonds at a yield just below the level expected several days ago, underscoring strong demand for the bonds despite last week's downgrade of Japan's debt outlook by Moody's Investors Service Inc. The bond sale was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record 37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled 100 billion in 12 million accounts today, 5 trillion in 170 million accounts. Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are. The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question. Here is what I want in just-one-fund relatively low risk broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones strong, consistent performance and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds but, curiously, not small-cap funds grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover which boosts tax bills should be relatively low. One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock 1-800-645-6561, which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven.
COBLESKILL, N.Y. -- Here in rural upstate New York, Tom Putnam heads an increasingly endangered species in the booming mutual-fund business an independent fund company that wants to stay that way. Mr. Putnam is chairman, chief executive officer and portfolio manager of Fenimore Asset Management, which runs FAM Funds, a family of two mutual funds with about 380 million in assets. The company, named after author James Fenimore Cooper, traces its roots back to the early 1970s, when Mr. Putnam's father sold the family textile business and invested the proceeds in the stock market. Having survived almost 25 years, the company managed private money before opening the first of two mutual funds in 1987 Mr. Putnam says he's laying the groundwork to survive solo the next 25 years, and hopefully longer -- despite a growing consensus that small fund companies can't make it on their own in the highly competitive mutual-fund business. Recently, mutual funds have been a hot commodity in the takeover game. They're commanding billion-dollar price tags amid an unprecedented wave of consolidation, spurred in large part by the theory on Wall Street that fund companies will need to gain size and name recognition to attract the attention of an increasingly fund-savvy investing public. The fund merger wave began several years ago and now even the most independent fund proprietors -- such as Dick Strong of the Strong Funds -- are for the first time weighing their options. It is no coincidence that Goldman, Sachs & Co. -- one of the biggest investment-bank players in mutual-fund merger business -- is set to release a new study this week to support a somewhat self-serving theory that smallto midsize fund firms must consolidate in order to remain competitive.
To find concrete evidence of the nation's worker shortage, one need venture no farther than the neighborhood grocery store. Or the convenience store. Or the closest mall. There's hardly a retail outlet in the Washington area that doesn't have a help-wanted sign hanging in the window, advertising a problem only too evident to shoppers whenever they need sales help or encounter an employee confounded by the cash register. The booming economy and historically low unemployment rates have created recruitment woes for all kinds of businesses, but the hiring headache is especially acute for the retail industry, where the void can be painfully visible to customers. Though the shortage exists nationwide, Washington area retailers are feeling an especially painful pinch. Not only does the retail industry have huge staffing requirements, it's near the bottom of the worker food chain, offering some of the most mundane and lowest-paying jobs. The result is that retailing is losing many potential employees to technology companies and other businesses, which are experiencing their own employee shortages and can lure workers with more money, better benefits and more interesting work. The tech companies are being more creative in who they're willing to hire, taking people and training them in technical skills. Before, these people might not have been able to find work anywhere else besides retailing, said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of member services for the National Retail Federation.
K-Tel International Inc., long known for peddling music on late-night television, has another hit on its hands K-Tel stock. Early last week, the company's shares changed hands at less than 7 a share. But with word spreading of the company's plans to sell music on-line, K-Tel shares have marched steadily higher. After gaining more than 22 last week, K-Tel shares were up another 12.9375, or 45, yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, closing at 41.625. Before the company's announcement less than two weeks ago of its plan to sell music over the Internet, K-Tel had so little attention that its shares didn't even trade on some days. With just 4.1 million shares outstanding, K-Tel's market capitalization has gone from about 30 million to 170 million in a week. Yesterday, the stock's volume was an astonishing 14.2 million shares, or more than three times the number of shares outstanding. Analysts said traders who had sold K-Tel shares short, betting on a decline in the stock price, were among the buyers in recent days. All this for a company that in its year ended June 30, posted net income of 3.2 million, or 81 cents a share, on sales of 75.5 million.
Enthusiasm about a new treatment for sexual impotence drove the shares of Pfizer Inc. to an all-time high in brisk trading yesterday. At day's end, it ranked as the top U.S. drug company in stock market value, passing Merck & Co. Analysts variously estimated that doctors are writing 15,000 to 40,000 new prescriptions a day for Viagra, Pfizer's 10-a-dose pill against impotence. Even if the lower number is correct, Viagra could turn out to be one of the most successful product launches in pharmaceutical history. Viagra was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 27, and has been on pharmacy shelves in most parts of the country for about a week. Most previous treatments involved creams, implants or injections. Urologists and other doctors who treat impotence say that men who have never talked about their problem are coming out of the woodwork to demand the pill. They're calling in on a daily basis, said Harold Bondy, an Arlington urologist who has already written about 20 prescriptions. They basically have heard about the tablet and they want to try it. Positive news about Viagra's sales drove Pfizer's stock price to a record 113.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, though by the close the stock had fallen a bit, to 113.37 12. That was a jump of nearly 8 percent from Friday's close.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices fell as the surge of corporate-bond issuance continued, led by the largest U.S. corporate global-bond offering to date. The bond sales siphoned interest from Treasurys and raised fears among some investors that savvy corporations are selling bonds ahead of rising interest rates. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 1232, or 3.75 for a bond with 1,000 face value, to 102 1132. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.95. A much-awaited bond deal went off without a hitch. Ford Motor Credit Co. sold a 3.25 billion two-part global offering, the largest such deal to date. In all, about 5.4 billion of corporate bonds were sold. The Ford deal, underwritten by joint lead managers Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co., was increased to 3.25 billion from 2.5 billion because of strong investor demand. There was overwhelming demand globally, with a fairly higher component of European interest than we've seen in the past, and smaller interest from Asia, said Paul Young, a senior syndicate official at Salomon Smith Barney. The deal validates the large-global-benchmark concept, that investors like these large benchmarks.
Technology companies ruled the stock market again, driving the Nasdaq Composite Index to its fourth consecutive record even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back. Bonds fell, the dollar was mixed and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also hit a fourth straight record. The Dow industrials closed at 9176.72, down 8.22. The index's decline was caused by International Business Machines, which fell 3 14 to 114 34 as investors sold after a six-point gain Tuesday. Each 1 Big Board move in a Dow industrials component means four points to the index. The Nasdaq Composite gained 13.74, or 0.7, to 1917.61 in only the second time Nasdaq volume surpassed one billion shares. The S&P 500 rose 3.87 to 1130.54. Technology stocks were powered in part by anticipation, which proved justified, that Microsoft's earnings announcement after the New York close would beat analysts' latest expectations. Intel also continued its gains, based on hopes of a stronger second half, and it pulled semiconductor and personal-computer stocks with it. Bank of New York's unsolicited bid for Mellon Bank helped to propel financial stocks, but it didn't create as much broad excitement as had previous news of other, friendly, bank mergers. Travelers Group, Chase Manhattan, American Express and J.P. Morgan all gained, but Citicorp and Merrill Lynch both fell.
WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees. And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by 115 billion in the next five years. The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the strength in the U.S. economy has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller. As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19 of taxable payroll from the 2.23 projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2 of taxable payroll. The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2 a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.
U.S. businesses are likely to spend at least 50 billion fixing Year 2000 computer glitches, a Federal Reserve official said yesterday, providing the federal government's first official estimate of such costs. The massive effort to reprogram millions of computers to recognize dates in the new millennium and, therefore, continue to function, could trim U.S. economic growth by a tenth of a percentage point in each of the next two years, he added. The problem is real and serious, Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward W. Kelley Jr. told a Senate committee, saying the total worldwide repair bill could top 300 billion. Kelley's projections bolster earlier forecasts by corporate analysts. Millions of computers -- some of which are central to running financial markets, air traffic control systems and even elevators in office buildings -- cannot distinguish between the year 1900 and the year 2000 because an old programming practice expressed years as two digits. Unless they are repaired, these systems will process the year 2000 as 00, and the computer will think it's somehow been transported back to 1900, which could cause it to shut down or turn out erroneous data. As the year 2000 gets closer, this bug is attracting high-level attention in both government offices and corporate boardrooms. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now requiring companies with publicly traded shares to disclose how much they're spending to fix the problem and how far along they are. Businesses have started to question readiness of their suppliers and distributors, while headhunting firms have started to offer lucrative signing bonuses for increasingly scarce programmers. And yesterday, the Senate took the unusual step of establishing a committee solely to press for rapid work on the issue.
Investment gurus have pounded that message into the heads of ordinary Americans in recent years, inspiring them to plunge into the market in record numbers. Now the notion that stocks generate much higher long-term returns than other investments is propelling another momentous shift in public sentiment, which may also end up channeling hundreds of billions of dollars to Wall Street -- from the Social Security program. On one side of the debate is an alliance of conservative Republicans, moderate Democrats and free-market economists who champion privatizing Social Security -- hitching its fortunes to the stock market and possibly transferring back to workers responsibility for managing a portion of what the government now collects in Social Security payroll taxes. The privatizers view their idea as an obvious and relatively painless way to steady the program's shaky finances. In making their case, the privatizers often brandish data of the sort displayed in the chart at the right. The graph, prepared by analysts at the Chicago-based investment firm of Ibbotson Associates, compares the performance of an index of large corporate stocks with that of 30-year government bonds since 1925, just prior to the Great Depression. The graph uses rolling averages -- each year's figure indicates the average rate of return over the preceding 30-year period. After adjustment for inflation, Treasury bonds -- the only asset held by the Social Security trust fund -- achieved an average annual return of 3.1 percent over that period. Stocks, by contrast, reaped an average return of 6.4 percent.
Infoseek Corp. appears to be the leading contender in a closely watched contest to create a new search engine for Netscape Communications Corp.'s popular Web site, people familiar with the matter said. A Netscape spokeswoman said the Mountain View, Calif., company hadn't made a definitive choice and that discussions continue with a wide range of Internet players. But the people familiar with the situation said the software company is in serious negotiations with Infoseek over a deal that would create a search service using Netscape's brand and tie the two companies together in other ways. Netscape could garner more than 25 million a year from Infoseek, own parts of Infoseek's technology and perhaps take an equity position in the company, they said. Word about a potential deal drove Infoseek's shares up 4.1 in heavy trading. The stock rose 1.3125 to 33.625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, while Netscape closed on Nasdaq at 27.3125, down 87.5 cents. But other potential deals remain in the offing. Netscape is still in talks with companies such as Excite Inc., Lycos Corp. and Inktomi Corp. about the role each could play in the reconfiguration of its Netcenter site, ranging from providing information to licensing software tools to paying multimillion-dollar fees for links to their sites from Netcenter, these people said. Not everyone is still talking, though. Executives at the Internet's top search and directory company, Yahoo Inc., have said they are unlikely to do any work for hire for Netscape and may not even purchase a position on Netcenter's search page, which Yahoo has done for several years.
NEW YORK -- Benign inflation data and soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials sparked the biggest one-day rally in the bond market in over six months, as investors regained their confidence that inflation will remain quiescent and the Fed will hold off on an interest-rate increase, at least for the next month. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1 2432, or 17.50 for a bond with 1,000 face value, at 102 1232. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell back through the 6 barrier that was crossed during Monday's rout, to trade at 5.944. Two-year notes rose 832 to yield 5.558, more than making up for Monday's loss of 632. The economic numbers caught people leaning the wrong way, said Barbara Kenworthy, who manages almost 9 billion in fixed-income assets at Prudential Investments. They take pressure off the Fed for a rate increase in May and a lot of the pressure off for a July move, though they'll have to see more data. The market's rally came on heavy trading, underscoring the marked shift in sentiment on the part of investors who earlier this week were counting down to an increase in interest rates. In all, 111.1 billion of Treasurys were traded, according to GovPx Inc., the second-busiest day of the year.
Since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, it has been open season for attacks on the International Monetary Fund. We have been told that the prospect of IMF bailouts caused the crisis and that the IMF's existence, if continued unchanged, will result in many more financial disruptions. Distinguished former cabinet officials, writing on this page, have asked Who Needs the IMF And this newspaper has added its editorial voice to the chorus. Here's a more balanced perspective In a globalized economy, everyone needs the IMF. Without the IMF, the world economy would not become an idealized fantasy of perfectly liquid, completely informed, totally unregulated capital markets. Investors and lenders would still make decisions on the basis of imperfect information, and they would have to take into account the absence of an international lender of last resort. This would be a serious, perhaps devastating, defect. In fact, we got a good sense of life without the IMF in the 1920s and 1930s. The results included widespread competitive devaluation and trade wars in response to balance-of-payments problems, followed by a plunge into global depression and world war. Without a guarantor of international liquidity, many good loans would not be made. Fundamentally sound private investment projects in emerging markets can be dragged down by decisions external to the businesses involved. Even prudent government policies can be waylaid by unforeseeable shocks. Either way, fundamentally good investments will run into temporary liquidity problems. In a world of flexible exchange rates, such temporary problems can be magnified by accompanying drops in the value of the domestic currency. IMF programs finance the adjustment necessary to give these countries and firms time to let their fundamentals pay off. Thus, the IMF is the sovereign nations' credit union. It imposes strict conditions on countries' policies for bridge loans to get through hard times. Only a multilateral institution like the IMF could exert the discipline required without causing an unacceptable affront to a country's sovereignty. The benefits to the borrowing nation are that the adjustment program will be less painful and any resulting contraction less severe. The benefits to the lending countries are not only the availability of those credits to themselves, if and when they need them as even the U.S. has, but a smaller contraction of world demand associated with the borrowing country's adjustment. Some have claimed that these IMF conditions have been misapplied in the Asian crisis, demanding either too much austerity or unjustified structural reform. But IMF conditionality is highly pragmatic. Since the current crisis was not caused in large part by macroeconomic policies, but by financial fragility and lack of transparency, the conditions were designed to respond to those causes. The fund has been ready to renegotiate its programs and to loosen austerity such as the inflation target for South Korea as matters stabilized. There always is room for improvement in individual IMF programs. But attacks on the basic idea of IMF conditionality are thoroughly misguided.
Before I take your questions, I'd like to make a few comments on a couple of matters that I believe are essential to the strength of America in the 21st century. Five years ago, we started a new economic course for a new economy, a combined strategy of fiscal discipline, expanded trade, increased investment in education, science, technology and our people. Today, we received more good news that that strategy is working. The latest economic report shows that in the first quarter of 1998, our economy grew at 4.2 percent. Wages are rising, while inflation remains low. This expansion is not fueled by big government deficits, but by booming business investment. In the first quarter, unemployment was the lowest in 28 years, inflation the lowest in 30 years, consumer confidence at its highest level in 30 years. For five years in a row now, our economy has been rated the most competitive in the world. We are living in an American economic renaissance in which opportunity is abundant. Communities are getting stronger. Families are more secure and more prosperous. But we cannot allow the hum of our growing prosperity to lull us into complacency. As estimates of the possible budget surplus expand, so too do suggestions that we immediately commit to spending that surplus on tax cuts and new spending.
The Clinton administration, worried that political upheaval in Indonesia could wreck the country's international economic rescue, is warning the government of President Suharto to show restraint in dealing with student demonstrations and other forms of dissent. But administration officials said that despite mounting criticism of the Suharto regime's human rights practices, they are not threatening to cut off Indonesia's 43 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund. Depriving the country of desperately needed cash, they argue, would only deepen its economic crisis and increase the chances of social turmoil and bloodshed. The IMF is expected to approve another 1 billion installment for Indonesia on Monday. Administration and IMF officials said that last-minute negotiations are continuing but that Indonesian authorities, after balking for months, appear to be complying with IMF demands for economic reforms, including the dismantling of monopolies run by the president's relatives and cronies. Behind the flurry of maneuvers lies the administration's anxiety about keeping the situation in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, from spinning out of control. Indonesia's financial condition remains extremely fragile, with its currency deeply depressed, inflation soaring and joblessness spreading. An outbreak of social chaos in Indonesia could spook investors in neighboring countries and cause the Asian financial crisis to worsen, U.S. and IMF officials fear. Moreover, the Indonesian archipelago straddles major shipping lanes, and civil strife there could disrupt global commerce.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed today just 37 points shy of its all-time high, capping a roller-coaster week that tested the market's resilience to renewed fears over higher interest rates. Interest rate worries, which sent investors fleeing from stocks Monday, began to subside as new batches of economic data made it increasingly likely the Federal Reserve would not feel compelled to raise rates at a scheduled meeting next month. A key business gauge released today offered more signs of muted inflation. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks jumped 83.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9147.07, a day after soaring 112 points on the first batch of good inflation news. For the week, it was up 82.45 points. Today's close put the Dow back within just 37 points of its record close at 9184.94, set on April 21. You have had two major shifts in psychology, going from bullish to bearish on Monday, and back to bullish with the economic statistics on Thursday, and the bond market acting better, said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson & Co. The National Association of Purchasing Management said today its closely watched purchasing managers' index fell to 52.9 percent last month from 54.8 percent in March, hinting at a slowing economy. But the report also said that prices paid by manufacturers kept declining, offering further heartening signs of subdued inflation.
Our story so far The Dow Jones industrial average triples including dividends in five years. Newsweek puts a muscular bull on its cover. The Economist of April 18 counters with a picture of a balloon, the headline, America's Bubble Economy, and the message that the stock market is headed for a crash, imminently. The Dow Jones industrial average falls 103 points from April 20 to 24 -- only the second weekly decline since Jan. 9. Then, on Monday, after news that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates, the Dow drops 147 points. Looks like trouble, and the newspapers are full of stories about analysts predicting a slide. But later in the week, the Dow bounces back by more than 200 points after reports that economic growth is strong and inflation nowhere in sight -- except perhaps in the stock market itself. All the blather about the stock market being too high or too low, about bulls and bears, about the latest GDP and CPI -- it's extraneous noise. Certainly, you should be alert to specific opportunities in individual stocks, and the economy and inflation sometimes influence the chances of, say, auto stocks or bank stocks that might be depressed. But what investors need to remember about the market as a whole are the simple things In the short run stocks are wildly volatile, but in the long run they are no more risky than Treasury bonds and money market funds. If you need your money in the next seven years, you have no business putting a significant portion of your wealth in the stock market. If you can keep your money working for the long term, it makes sense to be in with both feet -- as long as you can sleep at night.
WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's index of leading indicators moved up slightly in March, signaling that U.S. economic expansion probably will continue vigorously through 1998. Michael D. Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the New York business-research organization, said the economic omens point to continued strong growth in gross domestic product in the months ahead. It looks like above 3 is not impossible for the whole year, Mr. Boldin said. Last week, the government reported that the economy expanded in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 4.2, but few economists believe that pace is sustainable through the rest of the year. The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February. The March increase came largely from two of the 10 components that make up the index stock prices and money supply. Both of those measures reflect the strength of financial markets and are considered fairly reliable indicators of the strength of future economic growth, not just of whether the economy will stay out of recession. Other increases were seen in orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a measure of suppliers' delivery times. Declines were seen in big-ticket orders to manufacturers, excluding defense contracts.
A chorus of inflation-related worries pushed down stocks, bonds and the dollar, knocking back the Dow Jones Industrial Average from Monday's record. Traders said the declines didn't focus on one particular area. The industrial average lost 45.09, or 0.49, to close at 9147.57, nearly canceling out all of Monday's 45.59-point gain. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 13.95 to 1864.91 and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.57 to 1115.50. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 2332, or 7.18 per 1,000 bond, to push up its yield to 5.98, again approaching the closely watched 6 level. Traders blamed the broad-based declines on worries that the Federal Reserve might be preparing to raise interest rates at its next monetary-policy meeting May 19. Volume was relatively light as many investors chose to stay out of the market. Inflation worries focused first on April's employment numbers, due to be announced Friday. If those indicate strong gains, some people fear, it could push the Fed to act. Then word spread that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was scheduled to meet President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin yesterday afternoon. The White House said the meeting was on the economy, not interest rates, but speculation spread that they might be laying the groundwork for a rate boost.
CHRYSLER AND DAIMLER-BENZ are in talks about a merger, or even an acquisition of Chrysler by Germany-based Daimler, say people familiar with the talks. A combination, which could value the U.S. auto maker at more than 35 billion, would reshape the world-wide auto industry, creating a company with an estimated 130 billion in annual revenue. --- Robert Rubin urged investors to use more rigor' in evaluating the stock market's level, though the Treasury secretary didn't comment on whether the market is overvalued. Stocks, bonds and the dollar fell amid interest-rate worries. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 45.09 points to 9147.57. Rubin's comments that Japan shouldn't rely on a weakening yen for growth pressured the dollar. ---
Good economies make good politics. That's what Gov. Parris N. Glendening is finding as he stumps the state, touting rosy revenue and employment statistics while his opponents grumble and try to change the subject. Last week in Baltimore, Glendening D spoke before hundreds of people at the 14th annual Small Business Awards Breakfast. He briefly highlighted his administration's accomplishments, then added a bit of news Maryland's unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6 percent, the lowest level in years and somewhat below the national average of 5 percent. Unemployment was down in every single jurisdiction in this state, the governor said. Sitting seven seats to Glendening's left at the head table was Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke D, who last month defected from the governor's camp and endorsed a rival for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. And quietly sitting at another table, nearly lost in the huge hotel ballroom, was that very candidate Harford County Executive Eileen M. Rehrmann. Schmoke followed Glendening at the microphone and noted that Rehrmann and a few other elected officials were in the audience. He also praised the state economy and added This breakfast is also a tribute to our country. As Schmoke walked back to his chair, Glendening rose and shook his hand. The two men spoke quietly as the program continued, then parted with big smiles.
Are the giddy heights, and recent volatility, of stock prices making you a bit woozy You're not the only one. This week alone, two financial-services giants, Merrill Lynch and Vanguard Group, urged customers in separate mailings to consider bonds as a less-volatile alternative to stocks. The recommendations by Merrill and mutual-fund firm Vanguard appear to reflect widespread concern about the potential for a stock-market downturn that could follow a big increase in stock holdings by households and mutual funds held mainly by individual investors. Merrill noted that the share of financial assets in stocks held by individuals rose from 28 at the end of 1990 to 54 at the end of 1997. In contrast, Merrill said, the share for bonds shrank to 19 from 26 in the same period. And in a newsletter customers received this week, Vanguard's fixed-income chief, Ian MacKinnon, noted that bonds' returns are historically less volatile than those of stocks.
A New York bank, founded 75 years ago by garment workers who couldn't get credit from traditional banks, is opening its first branch in the District, targeting unions and their members. But workers who are looking for the union label will have to venture into an unfamiliar territory -- along the city's highbrow corporate corridor, downtown's K Street. Amalgamated Bank, the nation's only bank solely owned by a union, will begin taking new customers today at 1825 K St. NW, its first branch outside New York City. The labor movement is changing and we're changing with it, said Jay Mazur, chairman of the bank, which is owned by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. Founded in 1923 by the then-Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, the bank built a reputation in New York City for providing some of the lowest interest rates on loans and also paying some of the highest rates on money-market accounts. Bank officials say they hope to continue that trend, by offering free checking accounts with no minimum balance. Bank officials said many of their customers are not union members.
Asian stock markets and currencies plunged as antigovernment demonstrations in the Indonesian capital grew violent for the second consecutive day, sparking fears of wider social unrest and increasing political tension in Indonesia. The Indonesian stock market tumbled 6.6, but stocks dropped 24.4 in U.S. dollar terms as the Indonesian rupiah nose-dived again. In Singapore, stocks fell 4.9, Malaysia dropped 3.7, and Hong Kong plummeted 3.8. Adding to investors' concerns about Asia, news that India had conducted more nuclear tests caused panic selling in Bombay, where the stock market dropped 4.1. However, the Japanese stock market edged up 0.1, while South Korea, which had plunged in recent days on concerns about its financial system, gained 1.3. What we're seeing now are the social costs of last year's capital-markets crisis, especially in Indonesia, says Christopher Turner, managing director of independent financial consultancy I.D.E.A. in New York. We're going into one of those periods where the markets get the bit between their teeth, and we're telling investors to take cover. Nevertheless, a report in the Jakarta Post quoting Indonesia's President Suharto as saying he is willing to step down if his people no longer trust him helped send many markets higher as trading resumed in Asia Thursday. In Jakarta, the stock market was up 2.2 in early dealings Malaysia was 1.2 higher and Hong Kong had gained 0.7. Tokyo closed the morning session up 0.2, while South Korea was up 2.8 at midday.
Trailing in the polls with election day just four months away, Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a much-needed boost today from President Clinton, who heaped praise on Europe's longest-serving leader during a tour that had all the appearances of a political campaign. After celebrating one of the defining moments of the Cold War by marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, at Tempelhof Airport, Clinton escorted Kohl aboard Air Force One for a short flight to Eisenach, a town in the former Communist part of eastern Germany where they toured a modern car plant built by General Motors Corp. Clinton's visit was the first by a U.S. president to eastern Germany, and it was welcomed by Kohl, who lags far behind his Social Democratic rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls. Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990. Thanks in no small measure to the leadership of your chancellor, Germany today is one nation, in harmony with its neighbors, Clinton told a packed town square, as a beaming Kohl reveled in the praise of his foreign guest. During a foreign policy address Wednesday at Berlin's Schauspielhaus, a famous opera house located on what was once the Communist side of the Berlin Wall, Clinton extolled Kohl's record as chancellor for the past 16 years in terms that sounded like either an endorsement or a political eulogy.
For at least 30 years the U.S. has had, or at least professed, one fiscal policy Reduce the deficit, ideally to zero, preferably within five years. I was never crazy about this policy. I never attached significance to the number zero. The only thing one could say about zero was that it was 100 billion less than 100 billion and 100 billion more than negative 100 billion. This becomes obvious if you think of all the different plausible ways there are to define and measure budget surpluses and deficits. In the early Reagan years, when the deficit was large, I was not among those most eager to reduce it. Although I believed that the deficit was retarding growth by absorbing private saving that would have been productively invested, I thought that we were a very rich country and had more important things to do than speed up growth. I was a strong supporter of the defense buildup and feared that the deficit argument would be used to restrain it. Grand Goal in Sight I changed my mind recently as the deficit declined this year, the grand goal of zero seems finally achieved. In fact, I came to believe that balancing the budget was not enough and that we needed to get to a surplus. What changed my mind was the ever-clearer prospect that we would run huge deficits in the 21st century as baby boomers claimed their retirement and Medicare benefits. Although I was not one who wanted to maximize future growth, I would not like to see the growth of per capita income turn negative, and I was afraid that would happen if the federal deficit was so large as to absorb all private saving.
CACI International Inc. of Arlington yesterday said it plans to acquire QuesTech Inc., a Falls Church-based defense contractor, for about 42 million as part of efforts to expand its information security business. CACI, which provides software and support services mostly to U.S. government agencies, said it will pay 18.38 for each outstanding share of QuesTech, a premium of 27 percent over the company's Monday stock price of 14.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The acquisition includes about 35 million in cash and 7 million in assumed debt. News of the planned acquisition sent QuesTech shares climbing to 16.87 12 yesterday, up 2.37 12. CACI shares closed at 21.31 14, up 81 14 cents, on the Nasdaq. The acquisition, which does not include QuesTech's packaging division, has been approved by QuesTech's board of directors and awaits shareholder and regulatory approval. CACI's chief financial officer, James Allen, said he expects the sale to close in three to four months. The combined company would have annual revenue of about 350 million, with more than 4,000 employees in the United States and abroad. CACI has sought to expand into the information security market and gain a foothold in the U.S. intelligence community. In January, the company appointed Thomas McDermott, a former deputy director for information systems security at the National Security Agency, to head its information security operations. The QuesTech acquisition will bolster CACI's cache of security clearances and expand the pool of government contracts on which CACI can bid, Allen said.
Is Dell Computer Corp. unstoppable The company again blew by its competitors in the personal-computer business in its fiscal first quarter, continuing the tremendous sales and profit growth that has pushed its stock to six times its value at the start of 1997. In revenue, the company just passed International Business Machines Corp.'s PC division to become the world's second-largest PC seller. Of course, the company has a way to go to catch market leader Compaq Computer Corp., which is twice Dell's size and growing larger by acquiring Digital Equipment Corp. But Dell, more than any other PC company, is in a position to take advantage of the forces now shaping the industry accelerating declines in component prices, the pulling together of service and hardware, and close contact with customers. Dell's top competitors -- Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co. -- are trying to streamline themselves to match Dell's build-to-order and direct-selling efficiencies. But, says Charles Wolf, PC analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, The playing field is not getting more level. It's getting more tilted in favor of Dell. Despite its first-quarter strength and a bullish outlook for its second period, Dell's stock fell 2.8438 to 91.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Technology stocks broadly fell after poor results and a sour outlook from chip maker Analog Devices Inc. In addition, investors had built up inflated earnings expectations, anticipating Dell might beat forecasted profit of 42 cents a share by as much as five cents. Instead, Dell on Tuesday said it earned 44 cents a diluted share, or 305 million, in the quarter ended May 3. Revenue grew 52 to 3.92 billion.
The following is a report of how some major bills fared recently in Congress and a record of how local members of Congress voted. NV means Not Voting. BANKING For-214Against-213 The House passed a bill enabling banks, insurance companies and brokerages to combine into holding companies, for the purpose of entering each other's business. The bill removes barriers such as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act that prevent most forms of direct competition among major segments of the money industry. It changes government regulation by giving the Federal Reserve Board authority to oversee the new financial conglomerates. The Fed thus would become the chief regulator of national banks and their non-banking affiliates, replacing the Comptroller of the Currency in the Treasury Department as the main overseer of banks. Agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance examiners would continue to regulate specific financial services. A yes vote was to pass the bill. .... YES ... NO ...

They also would be denied exports that could be used for torture. Victims would receive the highest U.S. immigration priority. A yes vote was to pass the bill.
EDINA, Minn. -- Early in the morning of April 6, Wall Street got a wake-up call it won't soon forget. The news that Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. had agreed to merge in a 70 billion deal knocked many stockbrokers off their feet. When they recovered, many headed for the phones, calling their clients with short-term trading strategies to capitalize on the news. But not Noah Eisenberg. Mr. Eisenberg, a 16-year veteran broker with Dain Rauscher Corp. here, didn't even get to his suburban office until a half-hour before the stock market opened. Fresh from his usual 6 a.m. workout at a local health club, he found just five messages on his voice mail. None were from frantic customers who had heard about the Citicorp-Travelers merger. In fact, he didn't execute a single trade all day. A few years ago I would have been much more attuned to this, the 47-year-old broker says, pointing to a nearby television set blaring news of the deal. I would have had dozens of ideas of stocks I could sell. Now, it's just not that relevant to my business. That is because Mr. Eisenberg's business has undergone a fundamental shift during the past year and a half. Instead of playing the role of a traditional stockbroker -- picking individual stocks and charging his customers commissions each time they make a transaction -- he serves as more of an asset-gathering middleman.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that economic conditions in several hard-hit Asian nations have deteriorated in recent weeks and the fallout is only now just being felt by the U.S. economy. Greenspan, testifying along with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman before the House Agriculture Committee, said that part of the progress several nations made early this year in stabilizing their economies has been reversed. Until the situation fully stabilizes, we can't really have confidence that the Asian problems won't spread further through the world financial system, he said. Concern about the potential for such a contagion effect, and the increasing drag from the Asian situation on U.S. economic growth, are among the reasons the Fed hasn't raised interest rates this year to head off any possible acceleration of inflation. Fed policymakers last met Tuesday and left rates unchanged. At a March 31 Fed policymaking session, minutes of which were released yesterday, the uncertainty of the ultimate extent of retarding effects for the financial turmoil in Asia was among the reasons given by officials for not raising rates at that time. According to the minutes, the Fed policymakers expressed worry that rapid U.S. economic growth and tight labor markets would eventually lead to higher inflation if they persist. But most of the officials saw little urgency to tighten policy at this meeting, the minutes said. . . . The economy might well continue to accommodate relative robust economic growth and a high level of resource use meaning very low unemployment for an extended period without a rise in inflation.
Bonni McKeown says that the proposed Corridor H highway through West Virginia is a bad idea Close to Home, May 10. She argues that it is unnecessary to the local economy, will trash the environment and is a pork-barrel project of Sen. Robert C. Byrd D-W. Va. and a few businessmen. She is wrong on all counts. West Virginia has the third-highest unemployment rate and the second-lowest per capita income among the 50 states. Further, the six counties through which Corridor H will pass have a higher unemployment rate and a lower per capita income than West Virginia as a whole. Nearby counties, which also would be affected by the new road, have similarly dismal statistics. The 18-county region of 325,000 people has one of the poorest performing economies in a poorly performing state. The answer is the improved access for business that only Corridor H can provide. Improving existing two-lane roads, as McKeown suggests, won't work. Industries look for four-lane roads. In addition, the cost of the road improvements that she suggests would come close to equaling the cost of Corridor H. Building the corridor also would reduce the need for improvements to the state's two-land roads because it would divert traffic from them. As to the argument about trashing the environment In much of West Virginia now, the only jobs are in coal mining, timbering and other extractive industries. Corridor H would encourage a diversified economy, to the benefit of the environment.
It is no surprise that Patrick Buchanan has chosen to begin his next campaign for president with a book that blames free trade for all of America's problems. What is surprising is how ordinary, even restrained The Great Betrayal is. For the most part it is no worse than -- indeed is largely based on -- the sort of thing you can read all the time in the Atlantic, the National Interest, and other respectable journals. If Buchanan is prone to logical whoppers, garbled statistics, and warped history, he is no different from many other people who imagine themselves well informed -- although he is unusual in regarding the rising number of working women as a key barometer of America's decline, and perhaps also in concluding that imports, by driving down wages and thus forcing women into the labor force, have directly caused broken homes . . . delinquency, vandalism, crime. Let's get the economics over with quickly. Buchanan believes that thanks to free trade America is squandering its capital abroad that thanks to imports, bank loans, foreign aid, and U.S. defense expenditures overseas, too much of the seed corn of the U.S. economy is now being exported all over the world. Never mind the details though he gets many of them wrong Underlying this whole worldview is an almost ridiculous conceptual confusion. Apparently neither Buchanan nor his fairly extensive brain trust has noticed that the United States is a net importer, not exporter, of capital -- that we are able to run a trade deficit precisely because foreigners are investing more in the United States than we are investing abroad. This is not abstract theory It is a matter of unarguable arithmetic. Once you realize that capital is flowing into the United States, not out of it, just about everything else in Buchanan's argument falls apart -- unless you somehow think that when an American company builds a factory in Mexico, that counts, but when a German company builds a factory here it doesn't. Anyway, it is clear that Buchanan has little patience for close economic analysis His chapters on the subject have a dutiful feel, and one suspects that if he wrote them at all he did little more than transcribe extensive notes prepared by other people. What Buchanan loves -- and I think this is genuine -- is political history. Most of the book is, in fact, not about modern economics but about 19th-century political debates over U.S. trade policy. It has often been said that Buchanan wants to turn the clock back this book certainly reveals him as a man who loves our past, with a passion that verges on the -- gulp -- scholarly. But he does not love all of America's past. In fact, reading the book I found myself wondering where a rather large chunk of our history went -- namely, the great postwar boom. His book skips without a pause from the Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which he correctly identifies as the beginning of our long move toward free trade, to the economic difficulties of the later 1970s. Yet his own chart of U.S. tariff history shows that the great bulk of America's move from protectionism to free trade took place between 1934 and 1960, even though he chooses inexplicably to consider the relatively small tariff reductions since 1967 as defining the free trade era. And surely the prolonged era of unprecedented growth that took place as tariffs declined should at the very least count as evidence that liberalizing trade does not always produce evil effects. Indeed, most people who bemoan the current state of the nation look to the economy of the '50s and '60s as exemplifying the kind of broadly spread prosperity we would like to recapture. Yet Buchanan prefers to pretend that the whole period never happened. What he wants to restore, instead, is the pre-New Deal American economy -- an economy that achieved impressive growth although he may have forgotten that this growth was fueled in large part by massive immigration but also produced widespread misery and vast inequality. Perhaps he loves the distant past too much to find any virtue in times within living memory, or perhaps he dislikes the welfare state too much to acknowledge that Franklin Roosevelt's legacy could have had any positive side. Or perhaps, just perhaps, Buchanan is less populist than he claims to be He may put social justice in his subtitle, but he actually seems to long for the good old days when the gap between rich and poor was even wider than it is today.
Not even the Wizard of Oz slid as swiftly from apparent invincibility to apparent impotence as Indonesia's President Suharto. Now his demise seems readily explainable, as these things always are in retrospect. When his economic miracle morphed into economic crisis, Asia's longest-reigning dictator lost the legitimacy that had masked or excused his regime's many failings while allowing him to buy off potential foes. And when he was forced to kowtow so visibly to the IMF to ensure his nation's survival, he lost the aura of inevitable power that had kept so many of his voiceless subjects living in fear. So what is striking now, in retrospect, is not Suharto's fall -- not the apparently frail old man who emerged with trembling voice from behind the Wizard's curtain -- but rather how, up until the very last moment, the outside world doubted and disparaged Indonesia's People Power. Indonesia was not ready for democracy, was the consensus that only Indonesians chose to ignore Suharto could not fall. Why so many held so misguided a view for so long is worth examining now because many of the same voices can be heard again, touting stability over democratic change. The Clinton administration, to its credit, is no longer among them President Clinton quickly recognized Suharto's resignation as only the first step of a necessary process of democratic change. But many others seem ready to send the unruly students home. Enough upheaval for now, is their message let's get back to the business of healing a crippled economy -- even though Suharto's repressive system remains, so far, unchanged. Their logic is the same as when they were explaining why Suharto could not be replaced. Indonesia is too poor, and its economy too damaged, to manage a political transition now. The opposition is too fragmented, without ideology or program, united only in its disgust for the nepotism and corruption of the Suharto regime. There is no single opposition leader with the stature to unite a nation of so many islands, religions and ethnic groups. Mix in the absence of viable political parties and civic institutions after 32 years of stifling dictatorial rule. Recall the lack of democratic tradition in a country that has experienced only two transitions in the past half-century, both violent. Add a Javanese culture of patrimonial rule, communal values and mystical respect for power wielded from above.
A fresh wave of selling swamped overseas financial markets yesterday, as investors worried that the Asian economic crisis is worsening anew and that Russia is nearing the brink of default on its foreign debts. The plunge in stock prices hit financial centers from Hong Kong to Frankfurt to Johannesburg, evoking memories of the globe-girdling flight of capital that devastated markets last fall. Yesterday's sell-off initially hit U.S. stocks, too, with the Dow Jones industrial average down as much as 175 points at midday before rebounding to close down just 27 points. Among the hard-hit markets yesterday were Hong Kong, where the main stock index fell 5.3 percent Indonesia, where stocks tumbled 3.9 percent and Frankfurt, where share prices skidded about 3 percent. In Eastern Europe, which is closely tied economically to Russia, Polish share prices fell 3 percent to a four-month low and Hungarian stock prices dropped 3.4 percent to the lowest level since December. In early trading today in Asia, market indexes were mixed. South Korea's key stock index rose 4.2 percent, Japan's gained 1.4 percent and Hong Kong's was up fractionally. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia markets were lower. The darkest storm cloud hangs over Russia, whose main stock index plummeted another 10.5 percent yesterday, bringing its losses this month to 40 percent. In response, the Russian government tripled short-term interest rates yesterday to 150 percent in a desperate attempt to make investments in the country more attractive and keep the ruble stable.

The era of budget surpluses dawns, and the pilfering has already begun. Congress has just passed a huge transportation bill that busts the ceilings established by the balanced budget agreement just last year. And President Clinton, for his part, already has signed a bill containing a half-billion dollars of supplemental spending to pay for our Bosnia deployment. This not only broke Clinton's own pledge to save every penny of the surplus for Social Security. By blatantly abusing the loophole for emergencies the Bosnia deployment is already three years old and open-ended, it mocked the deficit reduction rule enshrined in the budget agreements of 1990, 1993 and 1997 that all new spending must be offset by cuts elsewhere. We are now enjoying a glorious and unique economic moment. We have the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. There is no inflation. Clinton has just announced a 39 billion budget surplus for 1998. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it might run as high as 63 billion. How do we keep from frittering away the current bounty Government cannot save its extra money by squirreling it away in a safe-deposit box. But it can do the equivalent by paying down the national debt, now a hefty 4 trillion. But how do you make politicians put away a surplus A little history. In 1968, in order to pay for the war in Vietnam and pretty up the numbers of a surging budget deficit, President Johnson arbitrarily decided to include Social Security in the budget. Social Security was then, as now, taking in more money every year from workers than it pays out to old folks. It helped LBJ produce balanced books.
Russia might seem a dubious candidate for an international financial bailout, given its chronic failure to stabilize its economy despite repeated dollops of foreign aid. Yet compared with an economic collapse in, say, Indonesia or South Korea, the prospect of a meltdown in Russia is far more frightening to U.S. officials and international economic policymakers. Therein lies the dilemma confronting the Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund as Russia undergoes one of the most serious bouts of financial turmoil in its recent history. The Russian stock market fell 15.1 percent last week, and is now worth about half what it was at the start of the year. The crisis has aroused alarm that Russia could default on its 145 billion debt to foreigners unless it receives billions of dollars in fresh loans. To critics of Russia's policies, providing such assistance looks like a classic example of throwing good money after bad. But the alternative may be a plunge in the value of the ruble that would devastate the nation's economy, kill public support for the reform program of President Boris Yeltsin and risk social chaos in the world's second-largest nuclear power. As a result, few analysts doubt that the international community will come to Russia's rescue again if the crisis intensifies. The odds are high that Russia will end up back in financial trouble even if it gets new loans, but nobody's going to let Russia go down the tubes, said Clifford Gaddy, an expert in the Russian economy at the Brookings Institution. It's always going to be bailed out somehow. The Russians have 30,000 nuclear weapons, and that's 30,000 reasons why they won't be allowed to go under.
WARNING Most of the hot companies touted by business writers are likely to cool off or fizzle in the next few years. I was reminded of this sad fact last week when shares of Manugistics Group Inc., a Rockville software firm, fell by half after the company said it would report a quarterly loss. Manugistics was among a dozen companies I had identified four years ago on The Washington Post's front page as a gazelle -- that species of fleet-footed firm that was reshaping the American business landscape and generating most of the economy's gains in jobs and productivity. There was Molten Metal Technology Inc., a Massachusetts firm that recycles hazardous wastes by dipping them in vats of hot metal. Now it's out of cash, in bankruptcy court and facing congressional investigation of its ties to Vice President Gore. And Discovery Zone Inc., the franchised fun center that grew too fast -- and is now just emerging from bankruptcy court protection as a smaller, private company. And Boston Chicken Inc., the home-cooked-meal chain that earlier this month reported a 312 million quarterly loss and the departure of its two founders. On Friday, the company's auditors warned that there was substantial doubt Boston Chicken could survive as a going concern.
After a 20-year absence, Ford Motor Co. is back in Thailand. Considering the country's economy, this isn't the perfect time to plunge back in. But, armed with some aggressive -- and risky-financing strategies, Ford is gaining strength in a difficult market. The world's No. 2 auto maker, which left Thailand in the '70s to focus on the U.S. market, returned about two years ago -- before the Asian economic crisis hit -- and now is seeking to become a market leader committed to offering auto loans to Thais when rivals can't or won't. Credit for auto loans is tight and sales have plummeted 75 since a currency devaluation walloped the country's economy last year. Ford is raising the stakes for itself by offering U.S.-style come-ons, including 0 interest. It's a big gamble, considering that the government has closed dozens of finance companies because of debt problems. Industry experts warn that Ford risks high default and repossession rates and a price war as wounded competitors match low interest rates. But price and financing are the main reasons people are buying right now, not brands or resale value, says Siriluk Aroondechachai, who took over her father's Ford dealership two years ago. Ms. Siriluk, through Ford's finance subsidiary, Primus Leasing Co., can offer a menu of financing options, including once-yearly payments for Thai farmers that coincide with sugar-cane harvests in northeastern Thailand, where she runs her dealership. During March, Ms. Siriluk, a 25-year-old with a degree in economics from Baylor University in Texas, sold 60 trucks in Thailand-enough to make some U.S. dealers envious.
According to conventional wisdom among economists and policy makers, Americans do not save enough. The suggested remedies include tax incentives for saving and policies ensuring that government programs, such as Social Security, do not discourage saving. But Americans save more than many believe, and in any case, future generations will be better off than the current ones even if saving does not increase. It is true that by official measures, U.S. net national saving has been low, by both historical and international standards. For a decade at least, the high measured saving rates in Japan were cited to explain why Japanese economic growth was so much greater than the U.S.'s. Japan still has a higher saving rate, but its growth has stopped. Most developed economies would be envious of the U.S.'s 4 economic growth rate and its unemployment rate of less than 5. It seems a bad bargain to change places with Japan, or any of the other nations with purportedly higher saving rates. But by appropriate measures, the U.S. saving rate is not really so low. The official measure of net national saving begins with gross saving, which has been rising. Gross saving reached 17.3 of gross domestic product in 1997. To calculate the net saving, usually viewed as national saving, one must subtract depreciation or consumption of fixed capital. This brings the rate of net national saving down to 555 billion, or 6.5 of GDP. That 555 billion would add about 2.8 to the current net stock of tangible capital, public and private. Thus it implies a growth in capital somewhat higher than commonly forecast long-run growth rate of the economy. Even this net rate might not be an adequate measure of growth in a period of rapid technological advance. The depreciated capital might be replaced by more productive new capital, so that even without adding to the measure of net capital stock the capacity for growth would increase. A better perspective could be gained by looking at real gross domestic investment, private and public. That total, financed in part by foreign net investment equal to 2 of our GDP, comes to 19.5 of GDP. This higher real percentage reflects the falling price of much investment, particularly in computers relatively more investment goods than consumption goods are being bought for each dollar. The net real domestic investment of 592 billion 1992 dollars in 1997 was thus 8.2 of real GDP, suggesting that real capital stock was growing even more rapidly relative to real output.
Textron Inc. is considering a sale of its Avco Financial Services unit as a part of a strategic review of the big consumer-lending concern. Based on its receivables outstanding of 7.73 billion and recent prices paid for similar companies, Avco Financial could be valued at about 4 billion. A sale of that scale would be the largest strategic move in the history of Textron, a conglomerate based in Providence, R.I., that makes Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters and has other operations in automotive and industrial-fastener manufacturing. People familiar with Textron's deliberations say that the company could decide to keep Avco after the review, but has been tempted by prices paid for other consumer loan companies recently, and has hired investment bankers Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan to hunt for bidders. Other possibilities would be a partial or total sale to another company or a partial stock offering. A sale of Avco would likely be followed by stepped-up acquisitions by Textron, which has purchased over 30 companies since 1992. The company has followed a strategy of add-on purchases that expand its current business lines. Textron Financial Corp., which lends money to buyers to finance purchases of Textron's manufactured goods and is the company's other major financial-services segment, isn't on the block or part of the strategic review. Avco's loans are typically made for used cars, appliances and goods purchased on installment at interest rates above prevailing bank rates. Avco also makes real-estate secured loans and underwrites insurance.
WASHINGTON -- Last month's robust job gains signal that economic growth in the second quarter -- even amid a trade-damping Asian financial crisis -- might not be slowing as much as economists previously believed. The unemployment rate stayed at its 28-year low of 4.3 of the work force in May, suggesting that April's drop was no aberration. The economy added 296,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. For the past six months, job gains have averaged 257,000 a month and the labor market has been taut. Wage gains were also healthy during May. Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased four cents to a seasonally adjusted 12.73. Average weekly earnings increased 0.9 to 441.73. Average weekly earnings and average hourly earnings have both risen 4.3 during the past year -- without many signs of inflationary pressures. The economy, though slowing from the 4.8 gross-domestic-product growth rate posted in the first quarter, still continues to generate jobs. Certainly, the Asian financial crisis has had an effect. The manufacturing sector has slowed its rate of growth in the second quarter, and manufacturing jobs declined 26,000 last month, the third drop in the past four months. Those declines, however, were offset by the brisk-paced service sector, which accounted for all of May's job gains. Business services, retail trade and financial sectors all boosted their payrolls in May. This shows that overall we can weather shifts in the economy, said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who used the manufacturing fall-off to underscore the importance of the International Monetary Fund's proposed Asian relief package. We need to support it to keep the Asian situation from worsening, Ms. Herman said.
FRANKFURT -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl may get plenty of pre-election mileage from May's positive unemployment numbers, but they aren't likely to result in an increase in interest rates by the Bundesbank, analysts said. Though the 60,000 decline in May's seasonally adjusted jobless numbers was good news and was evidence that the German economy was gaining steam, it was accompanied by a report that industrial output fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6 in April from March. The jobless figures were leaked prior to yesterday's official release. As early as Friday, Mr. Kohl cheered the numbers, saying the unemployment rate declined to 10.9 in May from 11.4 in April. Economists, however, dismissed the notion of inflationary dangers and any calls for the German central bank to raise rates pre-emptively at today's policy-setting central bank council. They said the link between employment and inflation in the U.S. doesn't apply in Germany, because the rate of unemployment in the U.S. is much lower than in Germany, and close to its so-called natural rate, where it poses inflationary pressure. The German unemployment numbers don't pose any kind of inflationary danger, said Hans-Joerg Naumer, economist at Societe Generale in Frankfurt. On the contrary, we'd be happy if the labor force were close to being used to full capacity.
The U.S. bond market and the dollar soared amid weak Asian markets and reassuring comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, but U.S. stocks declined, in a turbulent day for global investors. After initially gaining on Mr. Greenspan's hint that an interest-rate increase isn't imminent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 78.22, or 0.86, at 8971.70. Several earnings warnings drove down major technology stocks, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 27.51, or 1.53, to 1773.25. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.13, or 0.55, to 1112.28. Several traders said Asian investors were shifting money out of U.S. stocks and into Treasury bonds as Asian stock markets tumbled yesterday. The declines were sparked partly by rumors -- that China might devalue its currency, for example, or that a big Japanese oil company was about to go bankrupt. The continuing flight to quality moved more money into dollarbased financial instruments and pushed the dollar to yet another seven-year high of 141.49 yen, up from 140.22 yen. As if that weren't enough to push up bonds, Mr. Greenspan's comments reassured traders that interest rates aren't likely to rise soon, making existing bonds look more attractive. The 30-year bellwether Treasury bond rallied 1 832, or 12.50 per 1,000 bond, pulling the yield back to 5.697, the lowest yield since January. There was a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting to see how this bond market was going to break, said Scott Graham, head government bond trader at Prudential Securities. Once the rally started, cash flooded in, he noted.
New fears about Asia's economic crisis sent shivers through Wall Street today as investors fled stocks on concerns that the woes overseas will erode corporate profits in the United States. In one of the sharpest slides of the year, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 159.93 points, or 1.8 percent, to 8811.77, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.70 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1094.58. At the same time, the price of 30-year Treasury bond rose, pushing the yield down from 5.70 late Wednesday to 5.65 percent, the lowest level since the government began regular sales of the long bond in 1977. Analysts and money managers blamed Wall Street's skittishness on news that the Japanese yen had slipped to eight-year lows relative to the dollar, a sign that Asia's onetime economic dynamo may be far from emerging from its economic slump. Some investors believe South Korea, China and other struggling nations will be forced devalue their own currencies to remain competitive when selling their products in the United States. That would put them at risk of defaulting on loans from Japan, hurt the market for U.S. products and erode corporate profits here, money managers said. It's all kind of a vicious cycle of impact, said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed Financial Services in Overland Park, Kan. My heartburn has been going up. There's a lot of concern that, basically, all of Southeast Asia could default on loans to Japanese banks, said Jeffrey Tyler, senior portfolio manager for American Century funds. Japanese banks can't afford the strain.
Corporate profits have been getting a boost recently from a surprising source -- the surging stock market's effect on the value of corporate pension funds. These pension plans, once a drag on earnings, are boosting the financial performance of many of the country's best-known companies. The pension-fund bubble stems from the arcane accounting rules that govern the more than 1 trillion in private pensions. Under those rules, companies make assumptions about how much they will earn on their pension assets, how much they will have to pay out to future retirees and the future level of interest rates. But what has been happening during the long bull market is that those assumptions have proved too conservative -- and the funds have swollen far beyond expectations as stock market returns have outpaced historical trends. The excess, filtered through many layers of accounting, is dribbling down to the bottom line. And that's giving an extra boost to corporate profits at a time when earnings are being squeezed from lack of pricing power and rising wage pressures. Some companies are siphoning off some of the pension surplus to pay for other corporate needs, such as early-retirement plans, retiree health benefits and even merger financing. For many businesses, the gain is twofold Their plans are so flush they are being spared from having to make new annual contributions, and they are earning income from the excess that has built up throughout the stock market's rise.
The Asian economic flu is no longer afflicting the region's Little Tigers alone, and it's looking a lot scarier as a result. Until recently, the financial crisis that started in Thailand last summer and spread to Indonesia and South Korea was striking only at countries with relatively small economies. But now, much more important nations are coming under financial strain -- and the risks to the global economy are rising commensurately. While the United States is well situated to minimize damage and avert recession, the historic brisk economy that the country is enjoying right now faces a far more uncertain future as the financial turmoil begins to engulf bigger victims. In Japan, the world's second-largest economy, the yen and the stock market have gone into a tailspin in recent days amid a slew of bad news capped by a government report Friday confirming that a recession is underway. In China, fears are mounting that slowing economic growth will force the government to devalue the nation's currency in an attempt to make its products cheaper abroad and ring up more export sales. Fears that that was about to happen helped send currencies and stock prices tumbling last week in developing countries all over the world that compete with cheap Chinese products.
The tactic didn't do much for Beatrice or Borden, but now North America's biggest food company is trying to get more bang for its advertising buck by packing a variety of its grocery products into a single commercial pitch. Kraft Foods this fall will launch an unusual, new 50 million umbrella campaign, stuffing an array of food items such as Kool-Aid, Philadelphia cream cheese, Post cereal and Tombstone frozen pizza into a single television spot or Sunday circular. The idea is for Kraft to create an image that transcends its products, rather like Nike and Disney, says Robert A. Eckert, a former Oscar Mayer president who became Kraft's president and chief executive officer last October. No matter what you see from Disney, you know it will be family entertainment, he says. It might work for mice, but what about cheese Do people care whether Miracle Whip and Crystal Light are connected I am not so sure, says Kevin Keller, author of a textbook on building brand loyalty. He thinks such campaigns can help keep shoppers loyal if they already favor Kraft but might fail to draw new consumers. The ads, still under development at J. Walter Thompson in Chicago, will show a real Mom with a real Gramps and Lil' Sis, gabbing about how food helps them relate to one another. The touchy-feely message Kraft gets the importance of family values, and makes the kind of food that families with values eat. Kraft spent about 800 million last year to advertise its 50-plus major individual brands, from Jell-O Smile more to Oscar Mayer Just Whistle. This year, it plans to increase that figure by about 5. And all of our brands will contribute to the new umbrella campaign, Mr. Eckert says.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys surged again as Asian financial turmoil continued to make the haven of U.S. government debt very appealing. Meanwhile, other sectors of the bond market lagged behind Treasurys, with investment-grade corporate debt turning in a notably weak performance. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 1 732 point late yesterday, or 12.1875 for a bond with 1,000 face value, at 107 2332. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 5.579 from 5.664 late Friday. With an absence of market-moving news, traders said the bulk of yesterday's advance in Treasurys was powered by overseas investors fleeing plunging Asian and domestic equities for the safety of U.S. government bonds. The persistent ascent of the dollar against the yen continued to make dollar-denominated assets attractive. International investors want maximum exposure to U.S. Treasurys, said Chris Fitzmaurice, head of government trading at Salomon Smith Barney. They can't get enough.
Japan is in crisis, according to financial and political leaders in the United States and just about everywhere else. But here at crisis central, there are few signs that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is working feverishly on a rescue plan. Rather, he plays down the economic mess and focuses optimistically on how Japanese are in the enviable position of having piles of personal savings. On Sunday, Hashimoto gave a major speech and revealed that indeed he is worried, but his fretting was directed at nuclear testing and the fact that Japanese women are having fewer and fewer babies. At the end of last week, as the Japanese yen fell far and fast, causing every Asian stock market to sag, Hashimoto jumped on a plane and went campaigning for his party. A key reason Hashimoto seems to be distracted from Japan's and the rest of Asia's economic woes is next month's national election. On July 12, for the first time in nine years, his Liberal Democratic Party has a chance of capturing a majority in the upper house of parliament. If it succeeds, it will not have to appease and accommodate coalition parties. This is no small thing, and Hashimoto's supporters argue that, with a freer hand in parliament, he could act more swiftly on tough economic measures.
McDonald's Corp., cutting jobs for the first time in its 43-year history, said it will eliminate about 525 employees, or 23 of its home-office work force, over the next 18 months. The cuts, intended to shrink overhead and bureaucracy while increasing productivity, will affect quite a few in McDonald's 171-person U.S.-based officer corps along with lower-level workers, a company spokesman said. Some international-area employees also will leave the fast-food company. Saying it was still calculating the cost and potential savings of the downsizing, McDonald's put off disclosing the financial impact until it releases second-quarter earnings next month. Several Wall Street analysts contacted yesterday had only rough estimates on a potential charge, ranging from 20 million to several times that. The job cuts come as the Oak Brook, Ill., concern seeks to regain sales and profit momentum, particularly in the U.S., after two years of lackluster results. In one of his first announcements since being named president and chief executive officer-elect, Jack M. Greenberg said it is necessary to make these changes to refocus and realign with our restaurants and . . . bring home-office resources closer to them. Although the company said it was reducing its headquarters staff by 525 positions, about 100 of those posts are already vacant.
NEW YORK -- Investors stung by the 16 decline in SLM Holding Corp.'s stock since April 9 may get a chance to recoup their losses soon, but they'll need the federal government's cooperation -- and that is far from certain. Shares of SLM Holding, also known as Sallie Mae, began sliding over a government plan to price interest rates on federally guaranteed student loans off 10-year Treasury notes instead of 90-day Treasury bills, in effect cutting rates to one of their lowest points in 17 years. That was good news for students, but sacrilege to Sallie Mae and other lenders. Observers estimated that the changes would cost the industry at least 260 million a year, and Sallie Mae's stock has taken a hit on the prospect, falling to below 38 this last week from a 52-week high of 49.25 in April. Sallie Mae and other student lenders breathed a sigh of relief earlier this month when the government approved a temporary measure that prevents the lower rate from cutting too deeply into their profit margins. The three-month plan continues to price student loans off the 90-day T-bill but lowers the interest rate formula and provides a subsidy for lenders. But a debate is now brewing over whether the temporary fix should be extended for five years. According to the Department of Education, this long-term compromise proposal would cost taxpayers 2.4 billion.
Conceding that the Asian economic crisis has had a more severe impact here than first expected, Hong Kong's leaders today said the territory was heading into a recession, and they unveiled a stimulus package aimed at reviving the economy and stemming a huge downward slide in property prices. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, who announced the stimulus package in a television address to the territory's 7 million residents, said the regional economic meltdown that began a year ago has proven more devastating than anything we had known before. The effects of the turmoil are more serious and far-reaching than we have anticipated, Tung said. He cited high interest rates, a debilitating credit crunch, the highest unemployment rate in 15 years, collapsing stock and property markets and a tourist industry he said was shrinking. All Hong Kong assets have been devalued and shrunk to a large extent within a few months, Tung said in his most somber assessment yet of the territory's economic straits. Every sign points to the fact that negative economic growth will likely continue in the second quarter. The unemployment rate will probably continue to rise, and the economic situation for the second half of the year is hardly optimistic. Tung's bleak analysis, and the announcement of the stimulus package, was yet another sign of the depth and severity of the regionwide meltdown. Once touted as a miracle model of growth and development, East Asia has in the course of just 12 months come to be identified as a region with millions of new unemployed people, bankrupt banks, piles of bad debt and a fraying social fabric. Hong Kong was once thought to be an island of financial stability amid the regional turmoil. Its currency is firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar, so the territory avoided the round of devaluations that swept through Asia last year. Its banks are generally considered healthier than elsewhere. And its now-departed British colonialists left behind an effective legal system and a professional civil service that have largely spared Hong Kong from the problems of corruption and nepotism that are common across the region. Today, however, Tung conceded that some of the current problems can also be attributed to the internal factors in our own economy. He said the spiraling land prices, high wages and high inflation of recent years had created a bubble economy.
WORCESTER, Mass. -- For years, bankruptcy lawyer Paul Daley jokingly advised his Boston clients to get a phone booth in Worcester if they ever had to seek protection from creditors. That way, they would have an address here and be able to file through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, before Judge James F. Queenan Jr., a man whose reputation for debtor-friendly decisions has helped to draw cases from Boston and even other states. During the recession-induced bankruptcy boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Judge Queenan's court served as Chapter 11 Heaven, and since he was the only bankruptcy judge sitting in the western district of Massachusetts, petitioners who filed in Worcester had 100 certainty of drawing him. Then came Judge Henry J. Boroff. And bankruptcy lawyers say nothing has been 100 certain since. Brought in by an overworked Judge Queenan four years ago, Judge Boroff has gradually gained a reputation as being hard on debtors -- becoming, in effect, the anti-Queenan. While both judges are perceived as being fair and intelligent, says Joseph H. Baldiga, a bankruptcy specialist with Mirick O'Connell in Worcester, the perception is that Judge Boroff may not be as debtor-friendly.
AUTO SUPPLIERS suffer margin erosion, despite higher sales. Profit margins of the companies that supply parts to auto makers slid to 6.5 last year from a peak of 8.2 in 1995, says Automotive Consulting Group Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich. Still, suppliers are beating Ford and GM's margins of less than 5. The consultant studied the performance of 51 publicly traded suppliers from 1992 through 1997 -- a period when sales more than doubled as auto makers vastly expanded outsourcing of parts, systems and research and development. So why are vendors suffering An R&D burden means suppliers spend a lot more money before they make money, says Dennis Virag, president. That, plus a push for lower-priced parts, has pressured profits. Chris Quilty, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla., agrees some vendors have been squeezed. Air bags, for instance, went from a high-margin, high-tech product to a lowercost commodity. Both men say vendors who can innovate will continue to thrive. The UAW strike against GM may hurt suppliers now, but it could help them later if it leads to more outsourcing. GUN SAFETY' is advanced in one deft promotional shot by a safe company.
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The International Monetary Fund's revised pact with Indonesia to restart lending of 43 billion in assistance will allow Jakarta greater social spending and a budget deficit of 8.5 of gross domestic product for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. This deficit will be wholly financed by foreign borrowings and will, subsequently, require additional funds of at least 4 billion from outside sources, the IMF's top man in Jakarta, Hubert Neiss, said. But he stressed that these funds were urgently required to head off an economic emergency in the world's fourth-most-populous nation. Production and exports have been disrupted, unemployment is increasing, the banks are paralyzed, and food prices are rising, Mr. Neiss said. It's no wonder the rupiah rate has depreciated. Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hailed the new pact between Jakarta and suggested the U.S. will help Indonesia get the money it needs both from international financial institutions and other countries he wasn't specific. The success of the IMF program, he added, depends on Indonesia's ability to sustain both economic and political reforms. Financial analysts voiced surprise at the economic assumptions under which the IMF and Indonesia calculated this latest pact. The rupiah is targeted to end the year at 10,000 against the U.S. dollar, substantially stronger than its Thursday close of 14,700. However, many currency analysts fear that the rupiah could weaken in the months ahead, given social and political concerns. All of this raises the possibility that Indonesia's budget deficit could actually exceed the target of 8.5 of GDP. The government will probably have only two options to cover a bigger deficit, analysts say the seeking of even more international assistance or the restructuring of sovereign debt. Either way, one Jakarta-based diplomat said It looks like we the international community will be asked to cough up again.
It has been nearly a year since Thailand devalued the baht, setting off worldwide market drops -- and what a ride it has been. Most Asian portfolio managers would probably prefer to put the past 12 months well behind them, if they haven't quit their jobs already and decided to sail around the world instead. And pity the small investor, avidly checking up on the performance of his Asian mutual funds over breakfast only to find that day after day, Asian markets suffered staggering declines. Since July 2, 1997 when Thailand let the baht float, Asian currencies and stock markets have crumbled, jolting emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. Even the European and U.S. stock markets have felt the heat from Asia's plunge, though both markets have been resilient. So what's an investor to do now Steer clear of Asia, lighten up on U.S. holdings, and load up on European stocks, say the experts. Big and liquid is beautiful, says Leila Heckman, managing director of global asset allocation at Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
HANOI, Vietnam -- In a further sign of the grim business climate here, some of Vietnam's early-bird investors are flocking home. These investors represent that first wave of daring foreigners who jumped in when Vietnam first began opening its market in the early 1990s. They were once willing to spend the most money and take the biggest risks in the fledgling market, but after three or more years of losses, many are running out of patience. People are tired of waiting for economic reforms that come too little, too late, said Fred Burke, an investment lawyer at U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City. The first investors' departure spells yet another setback for Vietnam's economic development. Vietnam depends heavily on foreign venture capital to support a current account strained by hefty trade deficits. With very few resources of its own, the country depends heavily on foreign capital to fuel growth. According to ING Baring Securities Ltd.'s May report, foreign direct investment accounts for 8 to 9 of gross domestic product, and 17 to 18 of total export earnings. For the first six months of this year, however, total foreign investment dropped 20 in pledged capital, compared with the year-earlier period, according to government figures. Last year, foreign-direct-investment pledges dropped more than 50 from 1996. Economists fear the decline may be even more dramatic than the official numbers suggest.
From the commercial bustle of Shanghai to the renowned natural beauty of this city, President Clinton devoted two of the closing days of his China tour to a campaign aimed at persuading the Chinese that robust economic growth does not have to come at the expense of their country's fragile environment. Clinton spent Wednesday touting China's recent moves toward market economics, including a tour of the Shanghai stock market and a luncheon with young entrepreneurs. But his generally ebullient remarks were tempered by a dire warning about the damaging effects that China's industrialization is having on air, water, and food quality. Clinton continued to develop his environmental theme here in Guilin, where the Li River and the unusual limestone formations that jut up out of the valley floor create a striking natural tableau that has been memorialized for centuries in Chinese art. Cooling himself in sweltering heat with a colorful Chinese fan -- he called it an energy-efficient air conditioner -- Clinton told Guilin residents today China has a unique opportunity, because you are developing rapidly but later in time than other countries, to avoid making the same mistakes we have made. In the speech, Clinton announced a number of initiatives that will provide U.S. assistance to an incipient Chinese anti-pollution movement.
Shares of Theragenics Corp. plunged 36 Thursday after an analyst raised doubts about prospects for the maker of medical radiological devices. Theragenics executives, as well as other analysts, disputed the analyst's position. Nevertheless, Theragenics shares fell in Nasdaq Stock Market trading to close at 14.813, down 8.188. The selloff began after analyst Parice C. Halbert of Dain Rauscher Inc. in Minneapolis, cut earnings estimates for Theragenics and two other companies involved in brachytherapy. In that technique, radiological seeds are implanted in cancerous tumors, allowing patients to be given much higher doses of radiation than in traditional treatments. The treatment is most often used for prostate cancer. Shares of the other companies mentioned, Mentor Corp. and North American Scientific, also fell in Nasdaq trading yesterday. Mentor closed at 22.75, down 1.375, or 5.7. North American fell 25 to 14.25, down 4.75.
Bill Evans is a lobbyist who usually divides his time between Georgia and Washington. But last week he ventured clear across the country just so he could get an audience with the man some people were calling the pope of Congress. He joined a small group of thousand-dollar donors at the celebrity hangout Jimmy's Restaurant to spend a few minutes with Bob Livingston R-La., chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. When his moment came, Evans asked Livingston whether he could help resolve a dispute between his client, a paint manufacturer, and the Environmental Protection Agency over paint fumes. Evans walked away with the name of Livingston's staff director, James W. Will Dyer. We might be able to accommodate him with some language, Livingston said in an interview later. He meant that he might be able to insert some wording to solve Evans's problem in one of the annual spending bills he controls. For Livingston, the encounter was no different from what happens routinely in the hallways and reception rooms of Congress, where he answers supplicants by promising to examine their specific requests for legislative remedies. The significance was the setting. Bob Livingston, one of the Hill's consummate inside players, has taken his show on the road. Although he was on the verge of retiring from politics four months ago, the 21-year House veteran has now assembled a national fund-raising drive with the short-term goal of raising money for Republican candidates -- and the long-term goal of propelling himself into the speaker's chair.
Over the past three months investors would have been better off putting their cash in a money market fund or municipal bonds than investing in the average Washington area stock. Though conventional wisdom contends that the longest bull market in U.S. history is still thundering ahead, ambling would be a more descriptive verb when it came to the second-quarter performance of stocks of companies based in the District, Maryland and Virginia. The share price of the average regional company gained just 1.1 percent in the past quarter as measured by the Washington Post-Bloomberg Regional Stock Index. That was the poorest quarterly performance in a year, a dramatic slowdown from the average stock's 12 percent run-up in the first three months of the year. With money market accounts and tax-exempt bonds yielding an average 5 percent to 6 percent annually, local investors who parked their money came out ahead of those who ran with the bulls. Amid the plodding performance of regional stocks as a group, however, a handful of highflying Maryland and Virginia technology stocks were among the top performers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. They include
Is Amazon.com worth more than Barnes & Noble and Borders Group combined Some investors yesterday were questioning how much higher the valuation for the Internet bookseller could keep going. The stock yesterday dropped 17 38, or 12.5, to 122 18, after a sharp climb that left some market watchers agape. Even with yesterday's drop, Amazon.com is up a tidy 164 since June 8, the day before many of the Internet stocks started climbing in the wake of the seal of approval stamped on Web-related firms by the first of two important big-media investments in the group, an infusion in CNET by General Electric's NBC division. Post-tumble, Amazon.com's stock-market value still stands at 5.7 billion -- by itself nearly as much as the combined market value of Barnes & Noble at 2.95 billion and Borders Group at 2.94 billion, the two biggest chains of booksellers with actual brick-and-mortar bookstores. On Monday, Amazon.com's was actually greater than the other two combined. Indeed, Amazon.com isn't currently generating profits, and the 663 million in 1999 revenue estimated by Prudential Securities is less than one-tenth that of its two rivals. Prudential estimates Barnes & Noble will post 1999 revenue of 3.7 billion, and Borders will register 3.1 billion.
Nearly six years after the Food and Drug Administration banned silicone breast-implants, breast-augmentation is back. In just the past two years, the number of breast-implant procedures has soared nearly 40, according to a member survey by the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. Some surgeons credit a booming stock market, others the enduring popularity of the bosomy TV show Baywatch. Whatever the cause, more than 120,000 women in this country last year went under the knife to increase the size of their breasts for cosmetic purposes, the society says. At its peak around 1990, breast augmentation was the No. 1 form of cosmetic surgery, with about 125,000 to 150,000 procedures performed annually in the U.S., according to implant manufacturer Inamed Corp., of Las Vegas, one of two companies in the U.S. that still make breast implants. But then came questions about whether silicone implants might somehow trigger diseases such as lupus, arthritis or even cancer. In 1992, the year the FDA ban went into effect, the number of breast-implant procedures plummeted to 32,000. Although silicone breast-implants are still banned for cosmetic purposes in the U.S., some of the safety concerns surrounding them have been put to rest. In fact, even in this country, silicone is used for penile and testicular implants. Still, plastic surgeons and implant makers are touting breast implants filled with saline-water as a safer, more natural and more comfortable alternative to silicone. Saline implants now are used in more than 90 of all breast-enlargement procedures. It isn't as if saline-implant surgery is risk-free Common complications can include deflation of the implant, hardening of the scar tissue around the breast, and decreased sensation of the breast. After surgery, there may be bleeding, pain and infection. There may also be complications from anesthesia, including death.
Strong gains by the U.S. stock market on Tuesday helped to propel European and Asian stocks higher yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones World Stock Index up 0.43 point, or 0.22, to 199.78. Several European markets set highs, including London, up 0.8 Germany, up 0.1 the Netherlands, up 0.3 Finland, up 1.2 and Sweden, up 0.9. France, which was closed Monday and Tuesday, played catch-up with the rest of Europe and jumped 2.1, while Italy rose 0.4 and Switzerland slid 0.3. In Asia, Japanese stocks rose 0.8 and gave some support to other markets in the region, with Hong Kong up 3.4, South Korea up 2.2 and Taiwan up 1.1. Russia continued its rally with a 3.8 rise in the wake of the financial package assembled earlier in the week by the International Monetary Fund. South Africa rose 2. European markets rose 0.7 as measured by the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 665 European companies, which closed up 2.00 points at 311.57.
General Motors Corp. is suffering through its worst strike in nearly three decades because it says it must win increased productivity from its workers. A new report released here today provided fresh ammunition for the company's case by showing just how far the nation's biggest automaker trails its North American rivals. GM loses an average of 104 per vehicle on every car and truck it produces in North America, compared with an average of 1,520 earned by Ford Motor Co. and 1,336 earned by Chrysler Corp., according to an annual report published by Harbour and Associates Inc., an independent management consulting and automotive research firm in Troy, Mich. Looked at another way, GM would have to cut its annual labor and benefit costs by an average of 4,439 per vehicle to match North America's most efficient producer, Nissan Motor Co. in Smyrna, Tenn. GM also would have to eliminate 54,915 workers from its production payrolls, according to the Harbour report. The Harbour report is anxiously awaited every year by auto industry executives who want to see how their companies stack up against rivals in the crucial North American market. GM officials made little effort to sugarcoat the news about their bad report card, acknowledging that it shows the company needs to improve its performance. Ford executives were ecstatic with the report, handing out laudatory press releases at today's news conference. The report showed that their company beat the domestic competition in 1997 assembly plant productivity, posting four of the top 10 car assembly plants and eight of the top 10 truck assembly plants.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a 57 billion-plus agriculture spending bill that would restore money for President Clinton's food-safety initiative and provide 500 million in emergency aid for hardpressed farmers. The Midwest and Texas are two likely beneficiaries of the farm aid, which sailed through on a voice vote and the endorsement of the White House. After days of pounding by Democrats on a growing economic crisis in the Farm Belt, Republican senators appeared to have little will to resist. Even on the food-safety initiative, the GOP split almost evenly in support of the White House's position. Sen. Thad Cochran R., Miss., the bill's manager, joined in backing the amendment, adding 66 million for the food-safety program. Most of the money would go to programs within the Food and Drug Administration, and together with what was already in the bill, the White House will get a total of 68 million, or about three-quarters of its request. Final Senate passage last night came as the House narrowly approved a 26.6 billion Treasury bill after a seesaw battle driven by partisan politics -- and the always divisive issue of abortion. Attached to the measure is a precedent-setting provision requiring that health-insurance plans for federal employees provide contraceptive coverage. Antiabortionists have attached similar riders to ban abortion coverage, and the new provision is a major victory for women's rights groups. Beyond the abortion debate, the proposal touches on the issue of gender discrimination in health insurance. Young single women are often forced to bear the price of birth control, and if the contraceptives requirement is enacted for federal-employee health plans, it could have an influence on the entire health-insurance industry.
The average interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly this week, Freddie Mac reported. Thirty-year mortgages were up to an average 6.94 percent from 6.91 percent last week, while one-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose to an average 5.64 percent from 5.60 percent, Freddie Mac said. Fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgages were unchanged from last week at an average 6.60 percent, Freddie Mac said. Fifteen-year mortgage rates have not been lower since an average of 6.59 percent in the week of Feb. 20. A year ago the 30-year rate averaged 7.47 percent, the 15-year 7.01 percent and the ARM 5.55 percent. Mortgage interest rates are comparable to the low levels we experienced in 1993, Robert Van Order, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said in a statement.
Soaring computer-networking and Internet stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to its ninth consecutive record, but blue-chip stocks slipped amid worries about Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony, which starts today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had hit its latest record on Friday, declined 42.22, or 0.45, to 9295.75. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.65, or 0.22, from Friday's record to 1184.10 in quiet trading. The Nasdaq composite, however, rose 5.49, or 0.27, to 2014.25 on gains by companies such as Yahoo and Cisco Systems, even though Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer fell. Bonds gained the dollar was mixed. Many investors hope the Fed chairman today and tomorrow will hint that he is pulling back to a neutral position on interest rates, softening the Fed's current bias toward raising rates. Some economists even think that, with economic growth apparently slowing, the Fed could cut rates later this year, helping stocks and bonds. The 30-year Treasury bond gained 1732, or 5.31 per 1,000 bond, cutting the yield to 5.707. Bullish comments from two prominent Wall Street investment strategists didn't overcome sour news from several fronts. McDonald's warned of a difficult second half, while union members at General Motors' Saturn unit voted to strike, and soft oil prices hurt Exxon.
IBM said its second-quarter earnings rose less than 1 percent, to 1.46 billion, from a year earlier as revenue fell slightly. It blamed price cuts on personal computers, weak demand for mainframes and declining sales in Asia. Still, the per-share earnings of 1.50 beat analysts' estimates by a penny. McDonald's profit dropped 47 percent to 233.8 million in the second quarter largely because of the cost of installing a new food preparation system in restaurants nationally. Without the 350 million charge for the new system and for home office layoffs, profit would have risen 7 percent to 468.8 million. Fairchild Semiconductor, whose chips are the building blocks for electrical components in everything from toasters to cars, said it plans to fire about 200 workers because of the worldwide slowdown in the electronics industry. Closely held Fairchild, spun off last year from National Semiconductor, said it plans to trim payroll costs by 10 percent. The company employs about 7,000 workers worldwide, and the 200 being dismissed are based in the United States. The company also plans to reduce the payroll through attrition and cutbacks in contracted services. T-bill rates were mixed. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday fell to 4.950 percent from 4.980 percent the previous week. Rates on six-month bills rose to 5.045 percent from 5.025 percent. The actual return to investors is 5.081 percent for three-month bills, with a 10,000 bill selling for 9,874.90, and 5.250 percent for a six-month bill selling for 9,744.90. Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for changing adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 5.36 percent last week from 5.34 percent the previous week. SPX is buying General Signal, a maker of industrial and electrical controls, for about 2 billion. SPX, an automotive supply and parts company, said it will pay 45 per share in cash and stock for the larger General Signal, which is based in Stamford, Conn. Muskegon, Mich.-based SPX also will assume about 335 million in General Signal's debt.
Technology shares boosted the Nasdaq market today to a ninth straight record, but many stocks fell amid profit-taking before this week's report to Congress by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.22 to 9295.75 after retreating from an early 30-point foray into record terrain. McDonald's fell 2-1116 to 70-916 as the Dow's weakest component after the company met Wall Street forecasts with its second-quarter profit report but issued a cautious outlook for the second half of 1998. Most broad-market indexes also pulled back after Friday's record-setting advance, but the Nasdaq composite rose 5.49 to a record 2104.25, extending this year's gain to 28.3 percent. Cisco Systems rose 3-716 to 103-316 to lead the Nasdaq advance. Elsewhere in the technology group, IBM rose 1-1316 to 122 and Hewlett-Packard rose 1-1116 to 61 12, helping cushion the Dow's decline. After today's close, IBM reported a 1.45 billion second-quarter profit, surpassing most projections.
The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1 or 2. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable. Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies. Why does this matter to us The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of 15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles. The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly. The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by. International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home.
The following is a report of how some major bills fared recently in Congress and a record of how local members of Congress voted. NV means Not Voting. CONGRESSIONAL PAY For-79Against-342 The House rejected a pay raise for members of Congress. The vote occurred during debate on a Treasury Department spending bill for fiscal 1999. The bill prohibits a cost-of-living adjustment for members. Without the ban, a cost-of-living adjustment linked to 1998 inflation would take effect automatically early next year. The amendment rejected by this vote sought to remove the ban. Rank-and-file House members and senators are paid 136,700 annually, with leaders receiving more. A yes vote supported a pay raise for members of Congress. CAMPAIGN ADS For-201Against-219 The House refused to weaken the leading campaign finance bill before the House, a measure sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays R-Conn. and Martin T. Meehan D-Mass.. At issue was Shays-Meehan language that would begin federal regulation of political advertising, including TV and radio attack ads, that interest groups sponsor to help or hurt a specific candidate. Shays-Meehan would bring these issue advocacy ads under the spending and disclosure requirements that govern the candidates' own ads. With this vote, the House defeated an amendment that sought to soften the proposed new curbs on independently financed issue ads. ABORTION For-276Against-150 The House passed a bill making it a federal crime to transport a minor to another state for an abortion, in order to avoid parental consent or notification laws in the girl's home state. The bill does not apply when the abortion is necessary to save the girl's life, and it exempts parents from prosecution. A yes vote was to pass the bill. GUN DEALERS For-122Against-301 The House rejected an amendment to prevent 2 million from being paid to gun importers as compensation for inventory they lost when President Clinton recently banned the importation of certain assault weapons. The weapons were in transit to the U.S. dealers at the time of the April 6, 1998, ban. This vote occurred during debate on the Treasury Department's fiscal 1999 spending bill. The amendment sought to transfer the 2 million to the hiring of more agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ATF, a Treasury agency that enforces gun laws. A yes vote was to spend 2 million on ATF agents rather than to compensate certain gun importers for loss of property.
Money or power In the spate of megadeals announced this year, ranging from banking to pharmaceutical deals, there has been a common theme The smaller company gets either a premium price or its chief executive officer gets broad power-sharing arrangements in the combined company. But not both. As GTE Corp. investors found out this week, their company's executives got power, but shareholders got no premium in the 52.55 billion merger accord with Bell Atlantic Corp. GTE's shares, which closed Friday at 57.9375, are down 8.4 since news broke that it would accept a stock valuation that was below where its shares were trading. The 1.22 shares of Bell Atlantic that GTE shareholders will receive for each GTE share were valued at 55.13 as of Monday morning, and 54.06 as of the close of trading yesterday. Yesterday, GTE shares closed at 53.0625, down 2.6875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and Bell Atlantic closed at 44.3125, down 68.75 cents.
Harry Johnson, one of the top Canadian economists of this century, used to say that most things about economics are simple the problem is to recognize simplicity when you see it. This principle needs to be applied in explaining why the Canadian dollar has been dropping like a rock. The mystery here is that the Bank of Canada seems to be doing everything right, producing exemplary consumer price performance. But the loonie -- named for the loon on the face of the dollar coin -- hovers at 1.50 to the U.S. dollar instead of the 1.25 to the U.S. dollar that a consumer price-based measure of Purchasing Power Parity PPP, or the relative purchasing power of the two currencies, would suggest. The reward for monetary discipline should have been a strong Canadian dollar. Instead the legacy of inflation fighting by former central bank governor John Crow is a currency that seems to have no bottom. But while the Bank of Canada sticks to a strict anti-inflation diet, the Canadian government continues to consume a large share of the fruits of the country's productive capacity through a punishingly high tax rate. And this explains much of the loonie's loss of value. Some have argued that it is incorrect to measure PPP using the different changes in consumer prices between the U.S. and Canada. Producer prices are the main reflectors of international competitiveness, and if that measure of inflation is used the Canadian dollar's plight is slightly less puzzling. However, another argument has been advanced by WorldInvest International of London and Vancouver. It argues the PPP based on unit labor costs in manufacturing should be used to discover the Canadian dollar's theoretical value. WorldInvest notes that during the last 20 years unit labor costs have risen 109 in Canada versus 57 in the U.S. Correspondingly, the unit labor cost PPP of the U.S. dollar has moved from C1.08 to C1.40.
Should someone who's giving away 46 million be getting this much grief For the past few weeks, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has been putting thousands of checks in the mail to help homeowners pay their property taxes. But his critics are complaining, charging him with everything from misrepresenting the source of the money to trying to buy votes. Mr. Dean, in response, has accused one group of mud slinging at its worst. Is it any surprise that the culprit here is Act 60, the state's divisive education-funding law The prebate program is just the latest battlefield in the continuing war over Act 60. Like all elements of Act 60, the prebates are painfully complex. The law, passed in 1996, created Vermont's first statewide property tax, intended to provide more level funding for education across towns with widely varying property values and tax rates.
General Electric Capital will give refunds totaling at least 60 million to Montgomery Ward customers who were illegally targeted to repay their credit card debts even though they had filed for bankruptcy protection, the Federal Trade Commission said. Along with the FTC agreement, GE Capital settled a class action lawsuit and entered a consent judgment with attorneys general for all 50 states. Consumer credit rose by 6.7 billion in June to 1.256 trillion as auto loans advanced and credit-card borrowing staged a rebound, Federal Reserve figures showed. Analysts had expected an increase of 3.5 billion for June. The gain was the biggest since a 7.5 billion increase in March. Economists watch the Fed's consumer credit statistics because it helps them gauge changes in consumer spending. A jury in Los Angeles awarded 760.6 million in punitive damages to 38 former employees who claimed they were harmed by toxic chemicals while building the stealth fighter for Lockheed Martin. The judgment against Exxon, Unocal, Ashland, Shell Oil and DuPont, but not Lockheed, follows a compensatory damages verdict last week in which the workers won 25.4 million. Blacks, Hispanics and American Indians are being turned down for home mortgage loans more often than whites at every income level, according to a survey of 7,925 banks, thrifts and credit unions by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said he and Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II D-Mass. will request a Justice Department investigation of bank lending practices. Kennedy and other lawmakers also asked top banking regulators to overhaul their rating system for banks under community-lending laws. Two major airlines confirmed they are increasing fares by 4 percent on selected non-business flights. Delta Air Lines said the rate increase will apply to many, but not all, of its leisure tickets. Continental Airlines said it would match the fare increase in all of its domestic markets. Airline analysts said AMR Corp., owner of American Airlines, and American Eagle, also raised prices 4 percent, but company officials were not immediately available to confirm or deny it.
Wealth Two swallows don't make a consensus, of course, but scarcely a week after Jesse Jackson's Wall Street Project was in the news, the National Urban League launched a major push for black economic power. Jackson's not-yet-fleshed-out idea is for black Americans to acquire stock in national and local corporations, thereby giving black America an insider's view -- and an insider's influence -- on the workings of the commercial marketplace. The Urban League's equally inchoate notion is that it's time for black Americans to begin working at closing the wealth gap that can be expressed in this shorthand fashion Black household income, according to one recent survey, is about 62 cents for every dollar earned by white households. When it comes to wealth, however, the black share is about 8 cents on the dollar. The wealth data expose far deeper inequalities than the income gap, Melvin L. Oliver and Thomas M. Shapiro wrote in the essay that was the basis for discussion at the Urban League's recent convention in Philadelphia. Half of all white households have at least 6,999 in a net financial assets NFA nest egg, whereas nearly two-thirds of all black households have zero or negative NFA. A couple of things worth noting The essay is the lead article in the league's 1998 edition of The State of Black America, an annual report that used to focus on how awful things were for black people and how white racism was to blame.
EUROPE Romania Mulls Delaying Key Sale, Raising Concerns After making a broad commitment to move ahead quickly with the sale of hundreds of state-owned companies, Romania is now signaling that the auction for a 35 stake in RomTelecom could be delayed by weeks or even months. While such a delay wouldn't ordinarily be a big deal, postponement of the sale of the phone monopoly in the former communist country could make foreign investors uneasy. That's because the process is being closely watched by international financial institutions as an indication that Bucharest is serious about its commitment to reforming the economy.
The volatile stock market may provide all the risk that most investors can stomach, but some Wall Street investment banks are making much more daring bets pumping venture capital into fledgling Internet companies whose initial public offerings may be years away. Traditionally, Wall Street's leaders have avoided venture investing, leaving it to specialized boutiques that raise money from universities, wealthy individuals and others. But with many venture funds lately earning 50 or more a year, securities industry heavyweights such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. are pushing their capital into venture investments ranging from biotechnology to telecommunications. Some of the most hectic action involves tiny, money-losing Internet enterprises that investment bankers hope will be the next Yahoo Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. Executives of closely held Internet companies are watching this stampede with delight. In May, Ross Garber, chairman of Vignette Corp., came to New York to raise 7 million of venture-capital equity for his Austin, Texas, Internet-software company. After huddling with Goldman, Morgan Stanley and three other firms, Mr. Garber realized his sights were too low. We ended up raising 14.3 million, including 10 million from the investment banks, and we could have gone much higher, Mr. Garber says. I had bankers calling me at home on weekends, threatening my future livelihood if I didn't let them in for a bigger stake.
WASHINGTON -- The American shopper, the economy's chief engine these days, kept spending at a decent clip last month, though the General Motors Corp. strike damped overall retail sales. Sales for all retailers fell 0.4 in July from June, adjusting for seasonal factors but not for inflation, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the worst performance in more than a year, and reversed a modest 0.1 rise in June. But the weakness was almost entirely at auto dealerships, which saw sales plunge 3 for the month, following a 0.6 rise in June. Analysts blamed the drop largely on the now-ended GM walkout Excluding cars, retailers saw a decent 0.5 rise in business, more than making up for June's 0.1 decline in noncar sales. Consumers' spending predilections have taken on a heightened importance in keeping the economic expansion going, as the Asian crisis has forced a slowdown in manufacturing and threatened to curb business investment. Despite daily news of Asia's deterioration, though, American consumer confidence remains high. The consumer is continuing to carry the load for the economy, said Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Philadelphia.
There is little doubt that the economic crisis now gripping East Asia is the most severe shock to the global economy since the end of the Cold War. But it would be wrong to attribute the recent weakness on Wall Street to the crisis. There is no reason for the Asian crisis to depress the growth rate of the U.S. economy. Instead, it is likely to change the sectoral composition of growth within the economy. The crisis will set the stage for poor performance in companies producing tradable goods, but it will also create opportunities for profit in companies catering to domestic consumption. The data on the U.S. gross domestic product for the first half of 1998 illustrate how the crisis has changed the U.S. economy's growth mix. There was an unprecedented expansion of the trade deficit, to 252.9 billion during the second quarter of 1998 from 149 billion during the fourth quarter of 1997. This reduced real annual GDP growth by about 2.4 during the first half of 1998. But total annual output growth still averaged about 3.5 because domestic demand grew at a 6.5 annual rate compared with 2.4 during the fourth quarter of 1997. This upsurge was not a lucky accident, but the result of three positive side effects the crisis has had on the U.S. economy. First, the risk of further financial collapse in Asia and elsewhere has deterred the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to slow the growth of domestic spending. As a result, the U.S. economy is enjoying higher growth rates for home building, commercial construction and retail sales than it would have without the Asian crisis. Second, increased foreign demand for American equities and other U.S. financial assets has helped the U.S. withstand the Asia trade shock. The Asia crisis created a surplus pool of global liquidity that has driven U.S. equity prices to unprecedented levels. Foreign investors purchased U.S. equities at an annual rate exceeding 100 billion during the first quarter of 1998, compared with 66 billion during the whole of 1997. The buoyancy of the equity market has boosted household wealth while sending the household savings rate down to only 0.6 during the second quarter, from 2.6 one year ago.
MILPITAS, Calif. -- A new breed of American company is arising out of the relentless drive to reach global markets more quickly -- the stealth manufacturer. One such company, Solectron Corp., makes computers, printers, cellular phones and other high-tech gear. But you can't buy Solectron-brand merchandise. The famous names stamped on its products, such as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Cisco Systems Inc., hire it to make major parts. Overseas contractors have been doing such work for years. But Solectron's biggest plant isn't in Asia but here in Silicon Valley. More than 5,600 people work for it in California, in jobs that were supposed to have fled the U.S. a decade ago. The U.S. contract manufacturers are helping hollow out America's corporations while bolstering its manufacturing base. They land orders because they are considered among the world's most efficient manufacturers, and their proximity is prized because it facilitates quick product development. As a result, electronics manufacturing is thriving in U.S. plants run by contractors such as Solectron, SCI Systems Inc., Jabil Circuit Inc. and Toronto-based Celestica Inc. The U.S. contractors are the leaders of a 90 billion global business that is growing about 25 a year, almost twice as fast as the industry they serve. They are so efficient that companies such as H-P, IBM and Texas Instruments Inc. are, in effect, handing over to them their factories.
HONG KONG -- The government's unprecedented intervention in the stock and futures markets here last week came ahead of financial and economic news, all of it expected to be bad, causing market participants to question assertions that the action was aimed only at battling speculators. The intervention, a retreat from the city's legendary commitment to free markets, is causing some politicians and investors to ask whether officials were aiding the interests of Hong Kong's corporate barons as the economy heads into deep recession. Many of the stocks purchased by the government in Friday's intervention were in companies controlled by big developers, many of them key constituent stocks of the blue-chip Hang Seng index. The government said its stock purchases were meant to reflect the broad market, and were aimed at hurting financial speculators who were selling stocks and futures as a way of pressuring the Hong Kong dollar lower. The Hong Kong currency is linked to the U.S. dollar, but some investors are trying to force Hong Kong to break that peg. The government's approach to last week's intervention has raised hackles. The government is led by Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping magnate who is close to the handful of powerful tycoons who control much of this city's wealth. His cabinet is a virtual plutocracy of senior business leaders, whose popularity has sagged along with the economy this year. Last month the government's public-opinion poll showed that 54 of the population was dissatisfied with its performance, more than twice last year's disapproval rating. Because the intervention boosted the stock market sharply Friday, some market participants wondered whether the intervention was meant to distract from gloomy financial news coming this week. The government will release unemployment figures today.
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in June from May's record level, thanks mainly to a drop in imports. But most analysts believe the improvement will be short-lived. Inflation, meantime, remains in check, the Labor Department says. The Consumer Price Index for July rose a modest 0.2, seasonally adjusted, over June. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted 14.15 billion in June from 15.54 billion the month before. Imports fell to an adjusted 90.32 billion in June from 92.12 billion in May. Exports in June slipped to 54.61 billion from 54.72 billion. Underlying these figures is an across-the-board weakness in U.S. exports stemming from the impact of economic turmoil in Asia and some price cutting by U.S. companies acting to remain competitive. U.S. shipments to the Pacific Rim countries, for example, fell to 13.59 billion in June from 17 billion in June 1997. That continued a recent downward trend in exports to the region. The year-over-year numbers are the most accurate measure of the trend, as these figures aren't seasonally adjusted. But U.S. export weakness spreads beyond Asia, says David Levy, director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economic Institute, Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Based on a 12-month moving average, he calculates U.S. exports to Europe essentially have been flat since March. Mr. Levy blames the strong U.S. dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, and intense competition from Asian exporters.
WASHINGTON -- First-time claims for state unemployment insurance slipped by 2,000 to 301,000 last week, indicating the labor market remains extremely tight, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average for claims -- considered a better gauge of labor-market conditions -- fell by 4,000 to 303,000 for the week, the lowest level since Aug. 7, 1997. In a separate report earlier in the week, the Labor Department said the number of American workers laid off from 1995 to 1997 dropped sharply from the prior three-year period. A total of 3.6 million workers were displaced, according to the government's biannual survey, down nearly 15 from 1993-95. The study includes data from 1995 in both time periods. The study, reported in yesterday's New York Times, also found that getting laid off caused less trouble for workers as the economy improved. About three-fourths of people who lost jobs from 1995-97 found new jobs fairly quickly, a slight improvement over 1993-95. More than half of those who found new jobs earned as much or more than they had in their earlier jobs, a seven-percentage-point improvement over 1993-95. And while one in four laid-off workers suffered an income drop of 20 or more when they were re-employed, that was down from the one-third who saw such a decline in 1993-95.
WASHINGTON -- Former President Bush said in a television interview that he blames Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for his 1992 defeat. I think that if the interest rates had been lowered more dramatically that I would have been re-elected president because the economic recovery that we were in would have been more visible, Mr. Bush told interviewer David Frost. I reappointed him, and he disappointed me. Mr. Bush's economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, were critical of the Greenspan Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates more rapidly during the recession of 1990-91 and the sluggish recovery that followed. Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, was appointed by President Reagan in 1987, and nominated for another term in July 1991 by Mr. Bush, partly because he couldn't find an acceptable alternative. He was reappointed by President Clinton to a term that ends in 2000. A spokesman for Mr. Greenspan declined to comment.
The spread of the Asian contagion to Russia and possibly Latin America is raising the specter of deflation, which to many conjures up images of the bread lines and apple sellers of the 1930s. Back then, U.S. wholesale prices dropped 32 as demand nose-dived in the face of bankruptcies, widespread unemployment and massive pay cuts. Today we have financial crises aplenty in Asia, but they are unlikely to spread to the West. In the U.S., the long series of sectoral financial problems -- ranging from the farm-belt collapse in the early 1980s to difficulties related to the defense cutbacks of the early 1990s -- are behind us. Demand will probably not collapse in the West, even though there are some demand-reducing deflationary forces at work in the world. The Cold War is over, and the history of U.S. inflation is the history of wars. Since 1749, prices have risen at double-digit annual rates in wartime, but have fallen by more than 1 a year on average in peacetime. This isn't surprising, since the government is the only economic sector with enough financial credibility to outspend its revenues vastly and create excess demand for any length of time. Wars on poverty are similarly inflationary, but the passage of welfare reform suggests that Washington is serious about cutting nondefense spending. Government spending in Europe is hemmed in by the Maastricht requirements for deficits and debts. And despite eight years of a deflationary depression, Japan remains unwilling to enact major tax cuts for fear of the budgetary consequences. These are not the only deflationary forces at work. The Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to fight yesterday's war against inflation. Productivity-enhancing and cost-cutting restructuring prevails in this country and is spreading to Europe and Japan. Deregulation is bringing prices down. The continuing strength of the U.S. dollar encourages imports at lower costs, thereby forcing domestic competitors to reduce their selling prices. Even more significant are deflationary forces that increase supply. Global sourcing is mushrooming low-cost supplies, and not just of goods. Software engineers in India are working for U.S. firms at 20 of what Americans cost. The shift in both Russia and especially China from the command economy model to unbridled, buccaneer capitalism is also creating huge new sources of supply. The collapsed Asian economies, including Japan, desperately want to increase exports to employ their citizens and earn hard currency to service their huge foreign debts. Include booming high-tech industries, and global supplies of almost everything will surge while prices will necessarily fall.
Deflation knocked louder at the door of the U.S. economy as the Bridge Commodity Research Bureau index ended the day at a 12-year low. The index, composed of 17 major commodity prices, slipped early in the day below an August 1992 intraday low of 198.17 -- seen as a key benchmark -- and dipped to 197.72 before settling down 1.65 at 198.12. That marked its lowest close since 1986. The move was the latest slip in the index's year-long 39.57-point fall from 237.69, signaling commodity markets' two-year bear market may be picking up steam rather than abating. The Goldman Sachs index of spot commodity prices also slipped 1.41 to 139.6070, its lowest level since 1977. Most industry observers don't believe commodity prices will recover any time soon. It's falling like a stone, said Ray Murphy, president of RTM Management Inc., who helped BridgeCRB create a CRB total-returns index tailored to investors like pension funds. There's plenty of supply of everything and no demand. Where it bottoms out could be anyone's guess. And the free fall could have implications for other areas of the economy as well. Robert Hafer, managing director at BridgeCRB, said the CRB traditionally is an advance indicator of what conditions will be like in six to 12 months. He says if deflation spreads, it will show up next in producer prices and then consumer prices. That, he said, could necessitate a cut in interest rates. For now, however, the inflation-shy Federal Reserve appears unwilling to consider such a move.
Fund-raisers at Bowie State University spent extravagantly on banquets they weren't supposed to sponsor, cruises that few guests showed up for and dozens of other arguably wasteful items, according to an audit released yesterday. In all, the Bowie State University Foundation ran up a 181,968 operating budget deficit in just two years, forcing it to borrow from endowment funds contributed to the university, state higher education officials were told yesterday. The state university system's Board of Regents did not take action against any Bowie State officials yesterday, but Chairman Lance W. Billingsley said a subcommittee will decide whether anyone will be held responsible. Three months in the making, the independent audit offered an explanation of the financial scandal that has cast a shadow over the 5,400-student historically black college in Prince George's County and already forced the dismissal of three chief fund-raisers. The new audit also criticizes Bowie State President Nathanael Pollard Jr., saying he failed to check up on the foundation's finances.
The boos and whistles began raining down on Helmut Kohl as soon as he mounted the stage in the market square of this dilapidated industrial city. When the chancellor of German unity began reciting his achievements, the chorus of catcalls nearly drowned out his amplified voice. Kohl must go Kohl must go chanted many protesters in the crowd of 1,000 people, who had come to a campaign rally Thursday night to hear Europe's longest-serving leader make his pitch for an unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office. As police in riot gear shoved unruly demonstrators behind barricades, other spectators jeered and waved signs saying Thanks for 20 percent unemployment and Enough with your broken promises As he tours eastern Germany courting votes for the Sept. 27 national election, Kohl is confronting an ugly mood of disillusionment that has jeopardized his hopes for another comeback victory. Although some polls indicate he has narrowed the gap with Social Democratic rival Gerhard Schroeder to as little as 3 percentage points, the hostility Kohl encounters at nearly every stop in the east suggests he is making no headway in recapturing the allegiance of Germany's most fickle swing voters. Four years ago, Kohl came from 18 points down to win reelection with the help of an avalanche of votes from easterners still grateful to the father of German unity for liberating them from the bleak repression they endured under the Communist authorities of the German Democratic Republic. The republic collapsed in 1990 along with other Soviet-backed Communist regimes, and its five regions, along with Berlin, were folded into the Federal Republic of Germany. But rampant despair over widespread joblessness and embittered dismay with capitalist society have compelled many easterners to turn against Kohl with a vengeance. Many politicians and commentators now believe Kohl's Christian Democrats could tumble to third place in the east, behind Schroeder's Social Democrats and the former Communists known as the Party of Democratic Socialism.
The U.S. stock market ended the worst week of the year today on a down note, leaving it in the shadows cast by a bear market and deepening financial gloom around the world. After Thursday's dramatic plunge of more than 350 points, the Dow dropped another 114.31 points today, or 1.4 percent, to close at 8051.68 -- a loss in value of 5.65 percent for the week. Although the blue-chip average was up as much as 78.43 points early in the day, buyers hunting for bargain-priced stocks were timid and couldn't sustain the rally in the face of recent financial free falls in markets in Russia, Asia and Latin America. Although the stock market in Russia rose today, shares on Tokyo's stock market closed at their lowest levels in more than 12 years. Despite the turmoil abroad, the Federal Reserve isn't likely to reduce U.S. interest rates, a number of Fed officials said yesterday at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. However, the continuing turmoil and the likelihood it will slow U.S. economic growth has virtually eliminated pressure on the Fed to raise rates to restrain inflation, they said. Traders were glad to see the end of a tough week, when the Dow lost a total of 514.93 points. The Nasdaq Stock Market, heavy with technology stocks, took an even bigger hit this week, with the Nasdaq composite index dropping 8.8 percent to close at 1639.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 5 percent.
Two cut-rate mortgage ideas that haven't been seen nationally for nearly two decades have resurfaced this summer and appear to be picking up significant steam. Both plans allow home buyers to qualify for interest rates below prevailing market levels. Both work especially well for jumbo loan borrowers -- those seeking mortgages of more than 227,000 -- and for buyers who know they're likely to sell or move sometime in the coming four to five years. But both require you to strike a bargain of sorts with your lender. You've got to give up something to get the discount rate. The first oldie-but-goodie making a comeback is the prepayment penalty plan. In exchange for a fixed 30-year interest rate that's about 0.25 percent less than the regular rate, you agree not to refinance during the next 60 months. After that, you're free to do whatever you want. And during those first 60 months, you are free to pay off the mortgage loan without penalty if you move or sell the house. But if you prepay the mortgage balance simply to refinance with another lender, you get hit with a penalty, the size of which varies according to state law. In California, for example, the prepayment penalty can't exceed 80 percent of six months' interest. In other states, where such prepayment penalties are subject to different statutory restrictions, the penalty may be different, or not permitted at all.
The Federal Reserve isn't likely to reduce U.S. interest rates in response to the financial crisis that has swept Russia and many other nations this month, a number of Fed officials said here today. The added uncertainty about where the world economy is headed and the likelihood the crisis will be a drag on U.S. growth, however, has virtually eliminated pressure on the Fed to raise rates to keep U.S. inflation low, the officials said. William Poole, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who dissented in favor of a rate increase at a Fed policymaking session in May, said he no longer is pushing for higher rates. None of the other officials, including Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who are here for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's annual economic conference, would speak for attribution. But several of the 14 policymakers here agreed that damage to the economies of nations such as Brazil, Mexico and Canada from sharply higher interest rates and falling stock prices means a weaker world economy and downward pressure on prices for many goods and services. Like the turmoil that began in Asian countries last year, the latest developments will be a serious drag on U.S. growth by lowering demand for U.S. exports, particularly in Latin America. At the same time, slower growth around the world and falling prices for many products, especially basic commodities such as oil and copper, and the rising value of the dollar, will keep the cost of U.S. imports falling. That in turn will put downward pressure on inflation in this country, the Fed officials said.
The impact of the two-day-old pilots strike at Northwest Airlines will deepen today as employers in the markets it dominates return to work with few travel options. Business travelers from Detroit and Minneapolis raced home Friday night to beat the midnight deadline for the strike. But as Sharon Yourth, a regional manager for Baxter International Inc., said upon returning that night to Detroit's airport What am I supposed to do next week Now that next week has come, there is little hope of a quick resolution. The two sides haven't talked since the pilots walked out early Saturday. And Maggie Jacobsen, the federal mediator who supervised the talks, said in an interview that she had no plans at the moment to recommend that President Clinton invoke a rarely used law that would put the pilots back to work for 60 days, while a special panel investigates the deadlock. In Detroit, where Northwest controls 75 of the flights, General Motors Corp. is instructing its employees to drive to Buffalo, N.Y., and Dayton, Ohio, to find a plane. Still, the auto maker expects that the strike means about 20 of its planned business trips cannot be made. The situation is worse in Minnesota's Twin Cities, where Northwest controls about 80 of the gates at MinneapolisSt. Paul International Airport. Unlike Detroit, Minneapolis isn't located near other big cities, leaving big companies such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. and Dayton Hudson Corp. with no easy backup plan.
With yesterday's mini-meltdown on Wall Street, the question looms larger than ever Have the financial markets detached themselves from the real economy of jobs, incomes and gross domestic product For many economists, the answer is a fairly resounding yes. And they find it misguided to see the gyrations of the 1998 U.S. stock market as a reliable indicator of either a continued boom or an imminent bust. The stock decline is not telling us a thing about the U.S. economy, said James F. Smith Jr., professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. There's hardly anything wrong with the U.S. economy today that you can't solve with lower interest rates. It's tempting to believe otherwise, of course. It was less than eight weeks ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record 9337.97. Optimists saw it as proof of a new economic paradigm. Bolder types concluded, as they had in past years, that the business cycle had been repealed by tremendous strides in technology and productivity, justifying enormous leaps in stock prices. Today, just a few weeks later, doomsayers point to the plunging financial markets and the global damage inflicted by the Asian crisis.
While the incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades, the elderly have seen their financial circumstances improve dramatically, far outpacing every other demographic group, the Census Bureau reported yesterday. An analysis of household income from 1969 to 1996 showed a 57 percent rise in real median income for married couples over age 65, dwarfing the 6.3 percent increase for all households. Among elderly people living alone, incomes went up even more -- 63 percent. The improvements can be traced largely to increases in Social Security benefits and pensions, but also reflect a generation that enjoyed the combined effect of the G.I. Bill that gave many more college educations, a booming real estate market and the entry of more women into the labor force. These changes, said Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, have meant light-years of difference for that whole generation. In fact, the result has been to create a very different profile of retirement and aging. As late as the 1960s, many elderly ended up in county homes for the aged, a bed of last resort for those without income, family or health care coverage. Now, most older Americans are able to either live at home or, in a small but growing number of cases, move into retirement communities and assisted living facilities that enable them to live more active lives.
TOKYO -- As the New York stock market goes, so goes Tokyo. That has been the lesson of recent experience, but it hasn't worked out that way in the first two days of this week, when sharp declines in U.S. equity prices were followed by surprising gains in Japanese shares. Yesterday, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose 261.74 points, or 1.8, to close at 14369.63. On Monday, the Nikkei gained 192.26 points, recovering from a 12-year low of 13915.63 that it hit Friday. The yen strengthened against the dollar to 138.20 yen per dollar in late Tokyo trading, up from 141.50 yen Monday. Broad movements in the New York and Tokyo markets have recently been closely linked, as investors have started treating Japan's biggest blue-chip exporters much the same way they do their U.S. counterparts. So the fact that Japanese stocks were able to shrug off the 6.37 drop in New York on Monday raised eyebrows on trading floors across the nation and fueled speculation that the government had stepped in to support the market -- something that politicians from Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on down have promised not to do. There was no firm evidence that the government had intervened in the market, however. Although some traders interpreted buying by public pension funds as a sign of government support, other analysts said it was more likely that those pension funds were simply engaged in normal buying. While public pension funds have helped the government support the market in the past, these days they are burdened with huge unfunded liabilities and are desperately trying to earn better returns, making them unlikely proxies for a government interested in bolstering a sagging market. Instead, strategists think that fresh interest in Japanese shares, which many expect to be short-lived, mainly reflects a renewed caution among Japanese investors who are spooked by the turmoil in U.S. and European stock markets and willing, at least for now, to give domestic shares a second look. Some analysts suggested that the market rise also could be the result of hopes that the U.S. will cut interest rates in order to counter the effects of the U.S. stockmarket decline. Lower rates would mean a weaker dollar, which would help Japan's beleaguered banks.
It is a long way from Wall Street to this mountain community near the Indian Peaks Wilderness 30 miles northwest of Denver, but the ties that bind millions of Americans to the stock market even wind through here. As many other small investors did on Monday, real estate broker Liz Ford took a keen interest in the market's stomach-churning plunge. But not for the same reasons. Two weeks ago, the investing newsletter she subscribes to advised its clients to dump their holdings, and Ford moved about three-fourths of her 160,000 in mutual fund shares into cash -- everything except those funds that require a letter to sell. Her reaction on Monday Yes she said, pumping her fist in the air, savoring her adept market timing and anticipating buying back in at significantly lower prices. I didn't get out at the top, but I didn't get out at the bottom, either. Across the hall at the Fowler Real Estate office in this picturesque former tungsten mining town of 1,500 people, her colleague, Jim George, was not celebrating. But he was not despondent either, despite seeing his 90,000 investment nest egg shrink to 58,000 as of this morning. He took his biggest hit in a fund that he belatedly learned has 17 percent of its assets invested in Russian bonds, something he ruefully admits he would have known had he read the fund's prospectus. Nonetheless George is holding tight, having learned an earlier painful lesson when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the market dropped, and he sold and took a hit. When it's down this much, you can't bail out, said George, who now classifies himself as a long-term investor. Luckily I have 11,000 in credit left on my Visa card and the grocery store and the gas station take Visa. I'd love to get a 100,000 home equity loan now and put it in the market.
We should not fool ourselves that the recent sell-offs in world stock markets simply reflect a nervous reaction to Russia's turmoil or a long-overdue correction. They signify instead a gathering fear that the global economy is drifting toward a dangerous slump, driven by forces that world leaders only vaguely understand and seem powerless to affect. Even those supposed titans of global finance -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- give little hint publicly that they grasp the threat or know what to do about it. This is no longer a minor Asian crisis. Japan's recession is its worst since World War II. Latin America's economies are slowing. Mexico's economy -- which had been growing 4 to 5 percent -- will be lucky to grow 2 percent next year, says economist Desmond Lachman of Salomon Smith Barney. Russia's depression hurts its Eastern European trading partners. China is slowing. Together, these areas represent almost half the world economy's output. The United States and Europe, with another 40 percent of global gross domestic product GDP, cannot easily escape the fallout. Given today's prosperity, Americans are naturally disbelieving. Unemployment is 4.5 percent. Inflation barely exists. Exports -- the sector directly affected by the global slump -- are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP. But economists and others often blunder by projecting the present into the future. America's prosperity is precarious precisely because things can't get better they could easily get worse. How The economic expansion began in 1991. Americans have already bought lots of cars, computers and clothes. Consumer debt including home loans is high. In the first half of 1998, the personal savings rate was less than one percent. Until recently, the jubilant stock market made Americans feel wealthier. They are spending some of their stock profits since 1992, annual realized capital gains have roughly tripled. Now, lower stock prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending, which is two-thirds of GDP. Exports are already weakening rising imports further imperil domestic production. Why, then, would companies continue to increase investment 11 percent of GDP A recession is clearly possible. And a U.S. slump would compound everyone else's problems. The United States is the world's largest importer, and other countries -- from South Korea to Brazil -- need to export to recover. Lower interest rates would improve the outlook. Economist Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Relations rightly says that the Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank should cut rates by half a percentage point. Lower rates would ease debt burdens and help sustain consumer spending and home-buying.
MONTREAL -- Air Canada pilots went on strike, disrupting air transportation across Canada and into the U.S. several days into a similar walkout by pilots at Northwest Airlines. But Canada's biggest airline and its 2,100 striking pilots weren't far apart in their terms when negotiations broke off shortly before midnight Tuesday. With passengers scrambling for scarce seats on other carriers and the Montreal company losing millions of dollars for every day the strike lasts, some analysts said they expect the stoppage to end within days. Spokesmen for Air Canada and its pilots' union said yesterday they were prepared to return to the bargaining table quickly, though further talks hadn't yet been scheduled. As with the Northwest Airlines strike in the U.S., the Air Canada dispute stems from labor concessions in the early 1990s. The Air Canada pilots argue that a pay cut they took in 1993, combined with subsequent productivity increases, helped the carrier post a record profit last year. The pilots also claim they are paid 30 to 50 less than pilots for major U.S. carriers. Talks broke down late Tuesday night with the pilots seeking a 12 pay increase over two years and the company offering a 9 increase over that period. While the difference amounts to only about seven million Canadian dollars US4.5 million annually, Air Canada officials said they are concerned about the precedent for talks with other unions whose contracts will be up for negotiation in coming months.
Let's stop celebrating Labor Day -- by which I mean, let's stop assuming that the hard-won gains of organized labor in the United States are a done deal. And let's start using Labor Day to rededicate ourselves to the victories labor must win if it is to help working families in the 21st century. In some ways, the end of this century resembles the end of the last one. Corporations have regained the kind of unfair advantages over working people that they have not enjoyed for nearly 100 years. And with this, we find many of the darker impulses of the Gilded Age alive and well among today's entrepreneurs -- specifically, the willingness to roll over working people who seem powerless. In the 1990s, Americans are working harder than ever -- and they've got the stress to show for it. Millions now know what it's like to work uncompensated overtime in understaffed offices, or to work two jobs or to go without vacations and health insurance. For all this extra productivity that's been squeezed out of them in today's lean and mean workplace, the average American worker today earns less, works longer hours and spends less time with family. Workers kept their side of the bargain in making America more competitive again, but the gains they won were not equally shared. And this inequality is going to continue until workers become as organized as they did in the labor movement's prime. About 16 million American workers are represented by unions today. That's down 24.5 percent since 1980, at a time when our work force approaching 137 million is at an all-time high. Some say the reason is that manufacturing jobs have gone overseas. But the United States has more manufacturing jobs today than ever before -- the jobs just have moved south and west, to states where workers are not organized. Labor can't win better pay and benefits for members when employers down the street require unorganized workers to do the same work for lower wages and fewer benefits.
Stock-market investors, surprised by the quick delivery of a special prosecutor's report late Wednesday, found themselves sharing some of President Clinton's pain yesterday. But while more could be in store in the event of a protracted battle over Mr. Clinton's future, some Wall Street strategists say the market has a salve the continued presence of Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary and Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chief. It is times like these that you value people like Greenspan and Rubin, and we've got to make sure they don't resign or we're really in the soup, says Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Market strategists and other experts were quick to point to such factors that could cushion the market from the impact of scenarios ranging from censure to resignation to a full-blown impeachment proceeding stemming from the president's relationship with a White House intern. For the financial markets, the most important thing is that Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Rubin are still there, and are visible and active, says Prudential Securities market strategist Greg Smith. And in that case, I don't think there will be quite the sense of hopelessness that nobody is in charge. In the end, he adds, unless the Clinton affair prompts either of those two to resign or be ineffective, the president's problems are largely an unpleasant side show.
The unnerving spectacle of the stock market shedding almost a fifth of its value in less than two months might be expected to cool the enthusiasm of privatizers who want to give Americans the power to invest their Social Security funds in stocks. It has not. The market's recent imitation of a deranged elevator -- rising reassuringly one day only to plunge sickeningly the next -- comes as no shock to economists, policymakers and citizens who have faith that the long-term trend is up. But if these recent fluctuations worsen into a longer-term funk that lasts until Congress takes up Social Security reform, perhaps as early as next spring, proponents and critics said it could be difficult to pass legislation to shift part of the trust funds into private accounts. Rep. Mark Sanford R-S.C., among Congress's leading privatization proponents, said he worries that a continued market slide could hurt his side. The politics will be tough, real tough if the market sinks, he said. The idea's prospects could depend on where the stock market is going to be next spring, said Rep. Jim McDermott D-Wash., an opponent of private accounts. If the Dow Jones industrial average is at 6,000, nothing's going to happen. If it's at 12,000, well . . .  After hitting a peak of 9,337.97 points on July 17, the Dow began to fall, bottoming out at 7,539.07 on Aug. 31, a drop of more than 19 percent. It closed yesterday at 7795.50, still more than 16 percent off its peak.
TOKYO -- News that Japan has fallen into its longest economic contraction in five decades has led some economists and government officials to suggest that the country has nudged closer to a vicious spiral of falling prices, falling employment and falling output that would damage its economy even further. Economic activity fell 0.8 during the April-to-June quarter from the previous quarter, the government said Friday, an annualized decline of 3.3. And with spending by companies and consumers plummeting, there was almost no sign the situation will improve soon. The Japanese economy is walking along the edge of a deflationary spiral, said Taichi Sakaiya, head of the government Economic Planning Agency. Even before the gross domestic product numbers were released Friday, the benchmark Nikkei stock index plunged more than 5 amid concern over the economy and the gyrating U.S. stock market. At the end of the morning session on Monday, the Nikkei was up 30.12 points to 13947.10. The dollar weakened almost five yen during the Asian trading day as spooked investors brought dollar investments home and cashed them in for yen. The Japanese bond market touched another record high as yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, plunged to 0.79 on the benchmark long bond. Japan's report on gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced in the economy -- was a litany of problems that exceeded even the downbeat expectations of most private economists.
NEW YORK -- A mild sense of optimism emerged in the options market as the stock market rallied. But traders didn't make any major commitments ahead of this week's reports that will help Wall Street gauge the health of the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before a congressional committee, and expiration of September options contracts on Friday. What activity there was in the options market was premised on trading options in anticipation that the underlying stocks would move in a specific direction, a senior trader at a major New York securities firm said. Bargain hunters, which have maintained a constant presence in the options market, were active in sectors that have been ravaged, including technology, oil, bank and financial companies. People are getting back in the market in all different ways. People are re-establishing their general patterns of behavior, said Leon Gross, Salomon Smith Barney's institutional options strategist.
Anyone who questions whether we are living in a global economy needs to reflect carefully on the financial turmoil of the past few weeks. We can no longer escape the issue of how to manage in a world in which economic currents have no frontiers but our instruments to deal with them do. The International Monetary Fund lies at the center of this storm. It is the only financial institution that has some semblance of global influence. The IMF, however, is the subject of considerable controversy. The traditional approach of the IMF is to lay the foundation for healthy economic growth by restraining government intervention in the economies, ensuring sound currencies and encouraging open markets. Its policies have been a major factor in spurring unprecedented changes in the global economy. Current efforts to stabilize the Asian economies, however, are far different and more complex. Gone is the luxury of an exuberant economic environment. Commodity prices are plummeting. Interest rates in the affected countries are soaring, crippling banks and bankrupting business. Manufacturing plants throughout Asia have idle excess capacity. Unemployment is rising sharply. Devaluations and the fall of capital markets have drained substantial liquidity from global markets. The losses on the U.S. stock market alone since July are equivalent to the total annual GDP of all of the Latin American nations combined. Governments cannot balance budgets in the face of collapsing tax receipts, impeding their capacity to stimulate their economies. The problem for the IMF, however, is that the issue of corruption that got us into this predicament is just as real. As we see in Russia and many countries of Asia, this is the most pernicious contagion that has infected many banks and commercial enterprises. The result has been illicit enrichment and misallocation of resources, which taxpayers the world over are now being asked to pay. This will not do. The deep concerns about corruption reflected in the debate in Congress about IMF funding have to be addressed in formulating new policies. On the positive side, strong U.S. and European economies still exert considerable pull to lift the faltering economies of the developing world. The countries of Asia are now yielding large current-account surpluses, which could help them restore their economies if they have access to bridge capital. The issue is how to restore global confidence while not abetting corrupt practices or rewarding ill-considered lending.
Joliet, Ill. -- In this blue-collar city, both political parties will spend the fall vying for the attention and affection of citizens like Carol Rapcan. They will have to take a number and stand in line. Even as the presidential sex scandal fills the front pages, Ms. Rapcan says lots of things are more important to her life than national politics. At age 55, she devotes much energy to her three daughters. She is also focused on the good economy. A busy bridal-shop owner is practically begging her to come and do alterations. At her regular job -- working the gift shop at Harrah's casino in town -- Ms. Rapcan watches as more and more people line up to spend their extra cash. And in the past couple of years, something else has grabbed her by the heart Religion and the Lord, Ms. Rapcan says, clasping her hands together. Twice a week, she drives more than an hour to church. Last week, the sermon was on forgiveness. The week before, it was about seeing the good in everyone. Ms. Rapcan says she gets a lot more out of those messages than out of anything politicians can do for her. Apparently, she is one of many who place politics far down on the list of things that influence their lives. In the latest Wall Street JournalNBC News poll, the bulk, or 48 of people surveyed, say developments in medicine and health care affect their lives a great deal. About 46 feel the nation's moral values affect their lives a lot. And as the stock market dives and soars, 33 say the market and conditions of the country have a big personal impact.
The past two months have been punishing ones for investors in high yield, or junk-bond, funds. After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain. The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market, says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market. But too often, Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- just another bond fund with a higher yield. In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground. That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0 return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7 decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. But it is sharply worse than the positive 3.1 return on a Lipper index of government-bond funds and a positive 2.0 return on its index of funds holding high-quality A-rated corporate bonds.
Nike Inc. topped expectations for first-quarter profit but continued to be hurt by weak footwear sales and orders in Asia and the U.S. market. The Beaverton, Ore., shoe company said net income in the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 declined 35 to 163.8 million, or 56 cents a diluted share, from the year-earlier level of 253.1 million, or 85 cents a share. The latest results are eight cents a share above Wall Street's per-share consensus of 48 cents, as tallied by First Call Corp. But Nike's good news came mostly from spending less money in the period than expected. Revenue dropped 9.5 to 2.5 billion from 2.77 billion, while orders for footwear and apparel to be delivered between September and January declined 15 from the year-earlier period. Philip H. Knight, Nike's chairman and chief executive officer, said economic signals out of Asia continue to be negative, requiring additional cost-reduction steps. So the company also announced it intends to cut about 300 jobs in its Asia Pacific region, or about 15 of its work force in the region. There is not a lot of daylight as far as the economic crisis in Asia is concerned, Mr. Knight said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. Nike released its results after stock markets closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its shares fell 2.3125 to 33.75 and didn't trade after hours.
Stocks plunged today as U.S. investors mimicked their counterparts in Europe, Asia and Latin America who raced to sell shares after comments Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dashed hopes of a coordinated global reduction of interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 216.01 points, or 2.7 percent, closing at 7873.77. On Wednesday, when Greenspan made his comments while testifying on Capitol Hill, the Dow had eked out a 65.39-point gain for the day. But Wednesday night in Tokyo, investors saw things differently. Japan's key market index slipped to a 12-year-low, followed by similar declines throughout Asia and in Europe. When the selling wave hit the Americas today, it dragged down blue-chip stocks in the United States and also hurt other markets, including Brazil's. You have a market that's very nervous, said Robert Froehlich, chief investment officer at Van Kampen American Capital. Everybody's trying to determine if we've hit bottom. In a global marketplace, nothing is done in isolation.
The Senate began considering legislation to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws. A final vote is expected next week on the measure, which is being pushed strongly by the credit card industry to make it harder for consumers to erase debts through bankruptcy filings. But an amendment approved yesterday would bar credit card companies from penalizing or terminating card holders who pay their balances in full every month. U.S. inflation remained low in August, partly because of global economic troubles. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, the same as in July. So far this year, prices are rising at a 1.6 percent annual rate, compared with 1.7 percent for all of last year. Excluding food and energy prices, which many economists believe are too volatile to be a good measure of inflation, prices for other goods and services increased only 0.2 percent in August. For the year to date, these core prices are rising at a 2.5 percent annual rate, compared with 2.2 percent last year. Philippine Airlines, ravaged by labor conflicts and citing enormous losses, said it plans to shut down on Sept. 23 after 57 years of operation. A shutdown would make PAL the biggest Philippine firm to fold during Asia's economic crisis. Philippine President Joseph Estrada immediately called an emergency meeting with the airline's management and union officials in an effort to keep Asia's oldest national airline flying. U.S. farm exports in the first seven months of the year totaled 29.6 billion, well below the 31.2 billion in the year-earlier period, the Commerce Department said. The agency also reported that the U.S. agricultural trade surplus for January through July was 8 billion, down from 10.3 billion a year earlier. Large crops around the world, the strength of the U.S. dollar and Asian economic troubles have combined to take a heavy toll on U.S. farm exports this year. Chiron, a biotechnology company based in Emeryville, Calif., agreed to sell its diagnostics business to Germany's Bayer for 1.1 billion in cash. The company said that after selling Chiron Diagnostics it would focus on treatments for serious diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases on developing vaccines and on providing a safe blood supply.
From his office overlooking the docks in Portland, Ore., Scot Laney can see the effects the Asian crisis is having on America, as he watches the empty containers stack up. Laney, president of Griffith Rubber Mills Inc., believes the U.S. economy could benefit from an interest rate cut. Back in Washington, in the offices of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, the view is more opaque. Here, after recently acknowledging that American prosperity could be threatened by the escalating global financial crisis, Greenspan is weighing whether short-term interest rates should be reduced when Fed policymakers meet in 10 days. We're asking the chairman to be proactive, said Laney, who heads the National Association of Manufacturers' small and medium-size business subcommittee. The NAM is among a group of business interests from Wall Street to Main Street clamoring for an immediate cut in interest rates to bolster the U.S. economy and help combat a global economic slowdown. Businesses are calling for lower rates for a variety of reasons -- some of which openly are in self-interest. Some argue that cutting the cost of consumer and business borrowing would stimulate a cooling U.S. economy, and counterbalance falling foreign demand for U.S. goods. Others believe easier credit would provide a crucial psychological boost to skittish financial markets on Wall Street and overseas. It's the domino effect, said Laney, whose company makes window casings for heavy trucks and buses. Laney reasons that if shipments to Asia are slumping, there will be less demand for trucks to carry U.S.-made goods to and from the ports -- and eventually less need for Laney's products.
Proof positive that what's bad for the bulk of humanity is good for lawyers can be found these days in the Moscow satellite offices run by two D.C. law firms. It won't make anyone with devalued rubles feel better, but the economic crisis in Russia has been surprisingly easy on Steptoe & Johnson and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, both of which have Moscow outposts. The 13-lawyer Moscow office of Akin, Gump reports that its business mix has changed, without drastic financial consequences. Michael Waller, the managing partner there, said in a very long-distance phone interview that before the crisis the firm's capital markets lawyers were its main moneymakers. Those lawyers are basically idle now, but bankruptcy attorneys are more than picking up the slack. In fact, while the rest of the country, and many law firms in Moscow, are laying off workers, Akin Gump hired a new lawyer a few weeks ago. You have to structure your business so that you can provide services in a restructuring period as well as an expansion period, Waller said, predicting that revenue for the year will match last year's numbers. We were incredibly busy for the first six or seven months of the year, and now we're just normally busy. Meanwhile, Steptoe & Johnson Chairman Lon Bouknight reports the firm's six-lawyer office is considering some new opportunities. We represent people and companies that have been there for years and wouldn't have the ability to pick up and leave, even if they had the desire -- and they don't have the desire, he said. Firms specializing in capital markets have gotten pummeled, but the bulk of Steptoe's billables are generated through work on contracts, joint ventures and natural resource issues, he said. A lot of contracts need to be restructured now, and those natural resources are going to stay there in the ground notwithstanding the economic problems, Bouknight said. Moreover, the downturn will inevitably lead to a drop in the real estate market, which could translate into lower office rents.
Sure, this summer's stock market has been rough. But it will get better, right Most of us have bountiful optimism and abundant self-confidence. In many ways, this is a useful trait. Self-confident, optimistic people tend to be happier, more motivated and more likely to persevere. But when we turn to investing, this self-confidence can become a killer. A positive mental attitude, optimism and self-confidence are good attributes, says Steven Thorley, a finance professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management in Provo, Utah. But in the financial world, they just don't work. You're not interacting with people. You're interacting with prices. They don't care how you feel that day. In general, overconfidence is a negative. Overconfident investors tend to trade too much and tend to bet too heavily on particular stocks or market sectors, says Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University in California. These investors think they know more than they really do, and they buy and sell stocks on this knowledge. Trading volume is higher after a period of high returns, Mr. Statman says. That is consistent with the notion that people confuse brains with a bull market. They think that, because their portfolio is fatter, they are smarter.
Seven weeks after Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called early elections on the strength of his government's economic track record, Turkey is trying to weather the fallout from the economic collapse in Russia, its principal trading partner. Until this summer, Turkish officials had been predicting that the country would escape the economic contagion spreading from Southeast Asia. As of mid-year, the economy had enjoyed three years of steady growth, and Yilmaz's anti-inflation policies had won the approval of the International Monetary Fund and brought foreign investors flocking. But Russia's festering economic problems already had begun to erode Turkey's strong base, and the recent Russian financial collapse and the free fall of the ruble have sent shock waves southward. According to recently released government figures, Turkey's official trade with Russia declined 15 percent in the first half of this year. The unofficial export of textiles and other goods to Russia and other former Soviet Bloc countries, which earned the Turks around 8.5 billion in foreign exchange two years ago, is expected to bring in little more than 4 billion in 1998. Overall, Turkey has seen its trade deficit grow to 7.5 billion in the first half of this year. In addition, internal commerce is undergoing a cyclical slowdown, analysts say. Concerns have gradually spread among investors, who looked to Yilmaz to implement policies that might halt the economic slide.
The near-collapse of a huge and unregulated investment fund this week has prompted lawmakers to consider whether closer regulatory scrutiny is necessary to track the complex -- and often obscure -- financial deals these funds make with large sums of borrowed money. We are exploring . . . whether these funds that can pose a threat to the economic system or to the bank deposit insurance system should have more federal oversight, said Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on capital markets and securities. Wednesday, at the urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a group of 14 banks and securities firms agreed to provide more than 3.5 billion to rescue Greenwich, Conn.-based Long-Term Capital Management L.P. after fears rose that its demise would send a shock wave through the global economy. The once highflying fund faced losses on about 100 billion in bets it had made in financial markets around the world. Baker and the staff of other lawmakers suggested that the question of regulating this type of funds, known as hedge funds, could affect the progress of pending legislation to revamp 65-year-old banking and securities laws. Unlike most other financial companies, operators of hedge funds answer to no oversight institution, either state or federal, even though the funds make speculative, multibillion-dollar bets with borrowed money in markets all over the world. As recently as last week, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he had no problem with that arrangement. Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those who lend the money, Greenspan said in response to a question by Baker during testimony before the House Banking Committee. The major vehicle for supervision of lending is really from those who make the loans.
If the stock market of the 1990s is any guide, the meek will almost certainly inherit the earth. The fact is, boldness hasn't been rewarded in recent years. Ventured into emerging markets You got clobbered. Tokyo stocks They have been hammered. Smaller U.S. stocks After showing promise early in the decade, they too have faltered badly. Amid all this gloom, blue-chip U.S. stocks have barreled ahead, providing big gains for stock-market investors who were too timid to buy anything else. But even here, the more courageous have recently been singled out for punishment. Companies are often divided into two camps, growth stocks and value stocks. Growth stocks promise rapid increases in sales and profits. Often, they are the sort of companies we admire, like Microsoft, Pfizer and Wal-Mart Stores. That makes these stocks easy to own. Value stocks aren't nearly so lovable. Their sales and profitability are lackluster, which is why their shares languish at lowly prices compared with corporate assets and current earnings.
ASIDE FROM the odd short seller, there aren't many people actively rooting for further stock-market declines. But executive recruiters admit they'd be happy to see the market stumble a bit more. I'm paid to uncouple employment deals and extricate the talent, says Peter Crist, of Crist & Partners, Chicago. Extrication was difficult when the bull was roaring and executives were getting rich on options. Now, some of that wealth is vanishing. None of us wants a disastrous blow, but a little softening would give us some working room, Mr. Crist says. If your options are underwater, you're more interested in listening to my overture. The volatility of the stock market has created some interesting career quandaries for senior executives. Market gains aren't covering up mediocre results anymore, so underperformers are feeling the heat. Meanwhile, depressed stock prices can mean bigger profit potential on newly issued options, a potent selling point for recruiters attempting to entice star performers to jump ship. Plenty of people are still tuning out the recruiters' siren song, confident that the bull will eventually return, confirming the wisdom of taking a long-range view. Others refuse even to acknowledge the market's role in career decisions, saying that job satisfaction and the potential for increased challenge mean more than money. But let's face it The best senior-level people aren't about to change jobs without a financial incentive. And stock options have become the velvet handcuffs of the compensation game.
Investors were happy that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday, but sad that the cut wasn't bigger, so they bid stocks through a series of gyrations that finally left them little changed. In heavy trading at the time of the Fed announcement at about 215 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points in eight minutes. Then it climbed to its high for the day, only to fall again. The average closed down 28.32, or 0.35, at 8080.52. On the New York Stock Exchange, however, advancers and decliners were about even. Treasury bonds gained, since interest rates on new bonds will be lower than on existing bonds, and the dollar fell. Stocks already had gained in broad anticipation of a cut of at least one-quarter point in the federal-funds rate, the rate at which banks lend one another money overnight. Traders had been hoping for a larger, half-point cut. Few were surprised when stocks fell on news of the smaller rate cut, and some said the quick recovery could herald continuing strength. I think it kind of bodes well, said Bill Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read, who noted that some investors have been holding money out of the market. I think a lot of cash has been raised, he said, partly as window dressing for quarterly fund-management reports, to show that mutual-fund managers are being conservative.
BONN -- A group of Free Democratic Party campaign workers didn't find many takers when they tried to foist pamphlets and balloons on pedestrians here on the eve of Sunday's election. I asked one of them why the Free Democrats -- the closest thing Germany has to a Thatcherite or Reaganite conservative party -- were attracting so little interest. People here don't always like our message, he sighed. They don't want Germany to be like America. That is an assessment I heard throughout Germany in the run-up to the election. Alarming rates of unemployment and signs that the country is losing its competitive edge have convinced the German people that the welfarist social market economy that has served them since the end of World War II is seriously ill. But aside from the 6 to 7 of voters who regularly back the FDP, there is little support for a wholesale change of the old system. It is said that the laissez-faire capitalism that has fueled growth in the U.S. is somehow un-German and un-European, a risky experiment with what is perceived to be a uniquely American culture of slums, crime and rampant individualism. That mentality -- the desire for change, but only a bit of it -- explains the enormous appeal of Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's new chancellor-elect. He speaks in lofty terms of the future, but the success of his message is in its implication that Germany can reclaim a past when the welfare state seemed to work. The voters screamed for change, but all they really wanted is the promise of a more functional status quo. This is a conservative country with conservative attitudes, says Dieter Roth, a pollster with Forschungsgruppe Wahlen in Mannheim. He means conservative in the European sense The German people want security -- social security. They have been socialized behind the German economic model. Mr. Roth adds that while Germans don't fully believe it is possible to maintain a socialist economy in today's world, Mr. Schroeder has managed to convince the country that it just might be. What does this all mean for the future of the world's third-largest economy Despite Mr. Schroeder's claims, German socialism has seen its last days. Tanglesome regulations, one of the world's heaviest tax burdens and the most expensive labor force in the Western world are eroding the competitiveness of German corporations. The subsequent unemployment is contributing to a rotten culture of dependency. Sixteen percent of able-bodied Germans are unemployed if you include, as government statistics do not, sources of hidden unemployment, such as those given part-time jobs by the government.
NEW YORK -- Currency traders returned to a strategy that some say is the only clear bet they can make buy Europe, sell Japan. What that amounted to was the same market pattern repeated on numerous occasions in recent weeks -- the dollar falling against the mark, but rising against the yen, alongside a healthy rally in markyen. Analysts said Tuesday's quarter-percentage-point cut in the U.S. Fed funds rate suggests the Federal Reserve will make additional easings before year end, a process many believe will weigh on the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets less attractive. Notwithstanding recent signs that German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder favors softer monetary policy, the Bundesbank is believed to be adamantly opposed to German rate cuts. Add to this situation some additional bad news on Japanese banks yesterday and markyen looked like a strong buy, traders said. Markyen has been the favorite play of the past few weeks. If the mark gets through the 8283 yen level, it will look like people are really coming back to start selling yen again, said John McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York.
For months now we have been treated to Wall Street success stories in which investors such as Lobo Botonovitch have been cleaning up by throwing billions of dollars on the stock market floor and sweeping up billions of dollars in return. Botonovitch has been getting bad press lately because the more money he invested in his fund, the more it seemed to disappear into the sewer next to the Staten Island Ferry. Botonovitch decided the key to his fund's wealth was in Russian rubles. He started ordering all the rubles the Russians would let him buy. But they didn't call him the Whiz Kid of Wall Street for nothing, so Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust and the Nickel Savings Bank of New York joined forces to buy into the ruble market. What made the whole thing a gamble was that the Whiz Kid was losing his shirt on rubles. The reason was that the Russian people knew the rubles weren't worth an Indonesian rupiah.
NEW YORK -- The dollar continued its southward path yesterday, dragged down sharply against the mark and the yen by persistent concerns about U.S. and Latin American asset markets and the direction of U.S. interest rates. Systemic risk within the U.S. financial sector again weighed on the minds of nervous investors as falling banking stocks led Wall Street into yet another nosedive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7632.53, down 210.09 points, while the flight into U.S. government bonds pushed down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue to a 4.875, the lowest level for long-term bonds since June 1967. Meanwhile, the Bovespa index fell 9.6 in Brazil, where fears of a devaluation in the local currency, the real, are intensifying ahead of this weekend's presidential election. As went U.S. and regional stocks, so went the dollar. It fell to another 19-month low against the mark and gave up about half the gains it posted Wednesday against the yen.
The chairman of UBS AG stepped down today after an internal investigation by the Swiss banking giant revealed shortcomings in risk management in the company's dealings with Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the massive speculative fund that nearly collapsed last week. Mathis Cabiallavetta and three top executives were the first casualties in the upper echelons of the bevy of blue-chip financial firms that lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Long-Term Capital -- and then wound up rescuing the fund. But many on Wall Street are bracing for similar shake-ups, particularly amid public scoldings about a lack of lending controls at many institutions by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. There have got to be sacrificial lambs, said a senior Wall Street executive. We're all waiting to see who is going to take the blame. Executives of some firms speculated that lower-level managers may take the fall, particularly in cases where their own chiefs were unaware of the extent of the risk their companies were taking. Indeed, Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio today said he was unaware until this week of the involvement of Italy's Foreign Exchange Office UIC in Long-Term Capital -- even though he chairs UIC, which manages Italy's foreign-exchange reserves on the central bank's behalf.
WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration unveiled its plan to stanch the global economic crisis, including a new preapproved credit line for countries that fall victim to investor panic despite sound economic policies. With financial chaos rolling over East Asia and Russia, and threatening Brazil as well, the U.S. put forth a wish list that sharpens some old tools and offers some new initiatives, but adds no new money to the international response to the crisis beyond already-requested funding. The key element is the new preapproved contingency fund under the International Monetary Fund, a proposal that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven major industrialized nations agreed to explore at their meeting Saturday night. The G-7 gave a warmer endorsement to U.S. calls for more multilateral lending to battle poverty and fix troubled banking systems, as well as a U.S. plan to use multilateral guarantees to encourage private investors to put their money back into emerging markets. The IMF proposal, however, is likely to prove the most controversial element of the U.S. initiative. While other IMF loans require borrowing countries to agree to implement often-austere economic policies before they get loans, this new approach would be for countries whose policies the IMF judges to be sound already. But the idea appears to challenge the IMF's traditional insistence on strict conditions on its loans without such conditions, the IMF and others have argued, IMF money may be wasted.
By David Nicholson, a Washington writer, whose reviews appear Tuesdays in Style, and who can be reached at nicholsdclark.net. Now, don't for a moment take that to mean there's anything funny here. This is a serious book about a serious subject -- the horrors of war, how suffering can lead to healing, the hard choices the world forces where some can be saved and others must be abandoned -- and author Scott Anderson writes with grace and intelligence. But the secrets on which the book so heavily depends are like punch lines. Midway through, I'd already guessed one. And the second, which the author so clearly intended to be stunning, has a connect-the-dots quality to it, a quality that characterizes, and mars, too much of the book. Triage begins with the main character, a war photographer named Mark, wounded in an attack in Kurdistan and making his way to a primitive field hospital. There we are introduced to the process of allocating scarce medical resources to determine who will live and who will die that gives the book its title and theme. Though Mark is soon pronounced well enough to return to the States, he remains grievously wounded. Not physically, but spiritually. One sign of the extent of his wounds is his refusal to tell his girlfriend, Elena, the truth of what happened. I got lost in the dark and fell in a river, he tells her, got dragged over some rocks.
Try to ignore the storm-warning flags and enjoy the fourth quarter, because 1999 may be a batten-down-the-hatches year. That's the advice of most economists as the Southeast wraps up its eighth consecutive year of economic expansion. The region's gross state product -- the value of all goods and services -- will still grow at a respectable 3.7 annual rate in the next three months, ahead of the 2.8 pace forecast for the nation as a whole, according to eight economists recruited by The Wall Street Journal to forecast the Southeast's economic output. Among the reasons for the near-term optimism Interest rates at decade lows, lean inventories and payrolls, and an influx of retirees, second-home buyers and tourists from Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains to Florida's Sanibel Island. But with the exception of one shooting star -- South Carolina -- the Southeast's other five states are slowly losing their luster. Just last quarter, the panel of economists predicted growth of 4 for the six-state region.
Yahoo Inc. blew past third-quarter earnings expectations, driven by increasing traffic at its popular World Wide Web site and tighter expense controls. The Santa Clara, Calif., search and directory business reported net income of 16.7 million, or 15 cents a diluted share, compared with 681,000, or one cent a diluted share, for the year-earlier period. Analysts' earnings consensus estimate was nine cents a share, according to First Call. Yahoo's revenue tripled to 53.6 million from 18.1 million analysts had expected revenue of about 45 million. Yahoo's site has become one of the most-traveled spots on the Web, and the company attained profitability earlier than most of its rivals. Despite the relatively slow summer season, the company said it increased its daily page views -- defined as one electronic page of information displayed in response to a user request -- 25 to 144 million in September, compared with 115 million in June. In addition, registrations at Yahoo properties -- where users give the company detailed information to use its services -- grew by seven million to 25 million in the quarter. We are really starting to see the law of big numbers, said Tim Koogle, Yahoo president and chief executive officer. We are pleased with the growth across the entire business.
As part of their general pre-election cave in, Congressional Republicans are greasing the skids for 18 billion in fresh money for the International Monetary Fund. Having set themselves up in 1995, the Congressional leadership wakes up at night shaking with fear that President Clinton will veto a bill to keep the government open, then blame them for closing the government. With Asian economies toppling and the U.S. financial boom topping out, Republicans are particularly worried about getting tagged for an economic crisis unless they give Mr. Clinton anything he asks. The President lectured them again when speaking at the IMF meeting this week They should pay the 18 billion because there is no excuse for refusing to supply the fire department with water while the fire is burning. Before you pour liquid on a raging fire, we might suggest, make sure it doesn't smell like gasoline. On the record of the past 15 months of crisis, the IMF doesn't look like much of a fireman. More of an arsonist. Back in March 1997, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus gave a speech predicting for Asia at worst a cyclical correction that is not expected to be deep or prolonged. Mr. Camdessus was at that point already urging Thailand to devalue -- apparently clueless about the trouble that would come of it. The IMF went on to urge the devaluations that dragged down South Korea, wrecked Indonesia and set off shock waves that -- amplified by Russia -- now threaten Brazil. To combat this, the IMF began by pouring 18 billion into Thailand, and said the worst was over. Then the Fund led a 43 billion bailout for Indonesia and said all would be well. There followed 57 billion for South Korea, 23 billion for Russia. That comes to 141 billion. The fund is now arranging a similar 30 billion experience for Brazil, bringing recent IMF crisis-dousing to 171 billion. Yet clearly the world is in worse shape than when the Fund back in 1994 hopped on its fire engine to put out Mexico. Why is Congress buying in to this Three reasons.
On a gray day in a black week for government service, many of the town's impeachment-tossed met to say goodbye to two surpassingly splendid public servants, who, in their separate ways, had shown us how it should be done. Toni House was a blithe spirit who spoke for the Supreme Court. Kirk O'Donnell, a rock of decency and good judgment, spoke generally for Democrats and particularly for former House speaker Tip O'Neill. They both died young last month. Toni, who succumbed to lung cancer at the age of 55, was a radiant blonde. I knew her from the days when we both worked at the Washington Star. In the paper's last days, she was like a bright banner flowing around us. She wore one of those square paper caps that only printers know how to make, and she was everywhere. She carried news about people who had landed jobs and those who hadn't she knew about morale in classified and she gauged the rage of our overlords at Time, Inc. A photograph of her mourning as the Star's final edition rolled off the press said it all. When she went to the Supreme Court in 1982, Toni's fans wondered what kind of a fit it would be. Here was an institution more reserved than the Federal Reserve, stuffy and huffy and never explaining itself. When its members ventured out of their marble temple, they sometimes dropped speeches like hand grenades in the provinces. And there was Toni, who had been a police reporter, accustomed to trading expletives with recalcitrant desk sergeants who were trying to withhold information. But the match worked wonderfully well. Toni charmed the justices into some acknowledgment of the needs of the Fourth Estate. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once said of his place of business, We are very quiet there, but it is the quiet of a storm center. Toni was at the eye of the storm. On decision day, she presided over the distribution of the latest edict from the bench. It was always a mad moment, and Toni loved it. At her memorial service at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Lyle Denniston, a famously crusty Supreme Court reporter who now works for the Baltimore Sun, told about it through tears Toni was quite at home amid that chaos indeed . . . she was quite capable of adding to the chaos, but then also uniquely gifted at bringing everything back to order. All who spoke at her service conveyed Toni's greatest quality an obligation to be delightful. She took pride in her job, but she was also a fashion plate, a gourmet cook and an impassioned gardener. She brought picnic hampers into the office from home. She filled her office with flowers. She fed her cats lobster thermidor.
Limited international exposure and continued strong end markets helped U.S. building-products companies continue their streak of strong earnings in the third quarter. Except for company-specific problems at paint and coatings provider Sherwin Williams Co. and tool maker Stanley Works, analysts say they see little bad news coming out of the sector. They said the moderate inventory correction in retail home-center distribution channels was a second-quarter phenomenon. Although there are some individual cases where they're not, most of these companies are hitting on all cylinders, said analyst Peter Dannenbaum of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. While the Asian turmoil has hurt U.S. companies in other sectors, many building-products companies have little or no exposure to that region and so are immune from some global pressures. In addition, the companies don't have negative currency translations and few exports, said analyst Jonathan Goldfarb of Merrill Lynch & Co. All those global forces that are causing big earnings shortfalls don't affect them, so the earnings trends are especially strong, he said.
Don't go looking for it in Virginia yet, says Roy L. Pearson, who analyzes the state's economy at the College of William and Mary. The deep slump in Asian economies has spread recession and hardship there, with Latin America standing next in line and the U.S. economy looking at risk. But the crisis has actually helped Virginia thus far, says Pearson in a new report by the college's Bureau of Business Research. His analysis would apply to Virginia's neighbors, Maryland and the District, as well. Virginia's consumers have benefited as Asian manufacturers cut prices in hopes of boosting sales. The dollar's strength -- until recently -- also created bargain prices on Asian-made goods. Lower import prices contributed to lower inflation in this country, Pearson noted, making U.S. workers' paychecks go further. The recent drop in interest rates, engineered to protect the American economy from Asia's problems, have given another windfall to homeowners who refinance their mortgages.
Last year was a year of record profits for Criimi Mae, a business whose name no poet will ever make a sonnet of. Everything was going fine and then it collapsed on the same heap as hedge-fund guru John Meriwether. Criimi Mae managed a portfolio of commercial mortgages, buying half of all such securities underwritten by Wall Street. The strip malls, apartment buildings and supermarkets behind the mortgages did not all become delinquent. They're doing fine -- rents have held up, consumers continue to consume. The underwriters did not all flee to the Bahamas, leaving a wake of disorderly paperwork. What dropped dead was demand for mortgage-backed securities. This is what a bank run looks like in a world where banks are no longer the most important lenders. Superficially everything seems fine in the economy, but beneath the surface there has been a sudden withdrawal of liquidity from various markets that you didn't even know existed. This might seem a bad moment to be attacking the consumer credit industry. Yet the Justice Department last week filed an antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard. Let's see, the vital sectors of the economy now under assault include Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and 30 or 40 industries subject to grand-jury investigation. In a world ravaged by deflation, where the uniform wail of CEOs is that we have no power to raise prices, Justice believes now is a good time to go hunting cartels. The latest complaint is the usual quizzical piece of work. The credit card business is wildly competitive, with every mail bringing come-ons for lower rates, bonus points and higher credit limits. Some 6,000 banks issue Visa and MasterCard in ferocious rivalry with each other.
That hot U.S. job market It's getting cooler by the minute. After months of low unemployment and intense competition for workers, U.S. companies in a variety of industries have started a round of year-end job cuts. Nearly a dozen big firms have announced staff reductions in the past week in an attempt to bolster profits amid weakening sales and pricing. Wall Street felt the jolt on Tuesday, when Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, said it would cut 3,400 jobs, or 5 of its work force. The move had Wall Street employees bracing for cuts at other securities firms. Indeed, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. yesterday laid off 100 traders, salespeople and research analysts in its bond department, people familiar with the firm said. Analysts expect the BT Alex. Brown unit of Bankers Trust Corp., which has significant exposure to Asian markets, to eliminate as much as 10 of its staff of 18,000. This round of downsizing is turning out to be surprisingly nondiscriminatory, affecting companies ranging from banks to makers of exercise equipment. Last week, Lexington, Mass., defense contractor Raytheon Co. boosted the total number of jobs it will cut to 14,000, or 16 of its work force, from the 8,700 it said it would cut last January. Los Angeles oil concern Atlantic Richfield Co. jumped in yesterday, announcing it will eliminate 900 jobs, or nearly 5 of its work force. The reason fears that the global economic slowdown won't reverse itself anytime soon. We've taken a look at what's going on in the world, and we've decided we have a situation that could hang around for a period of time, said Lee Tashjian, an Arco spokesman.
Home buyer Duane Rollins had secured a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage last May at a decent 6.75 percent interest rate so he could buy a small, one-bedroom house in Kensington. Nonetheless, he still needed several thousand dollars to cover his closing costs, even though he wasn't sure exactly how much. What Rollins, 35, a facilities manager for a nonprofit group in the District, did know was where to turn for the cash a retirement fund he had set up with a previous employer. I got close to 10,000 because I couldn't get a hard figure on my closing costs, he said. But when he ended up only needing 2,600 to settle the loan, he decided to use the rest of the money to help pay the cost of expanding the house, a former photographer's studio, to 1,700 square feet of living space. Rollins is one of a growing number of consumers in the Washington area and across the country who are using a portion of their retirement nest eggs toward the purchase of a house. Whether taken as a loan or pledged as collateral in a mortgage application, such funds have become an attractive source of money for down payments, settlements, moving and decorating costs, and paying commissions to real estate agents, lenders and financial planners said. Loans from 401k and other employee-directed retirement savings plans lately have blossomed in tandem with the stock market's growth, which boosted earnings among the mutual funds that launched many retirement plans, even if the bottom line for many savers has diminished since mid-July. Retirement savings accounts, whether 401k, profit-sharing or some combination plan, have earned an average compounded annual return of 11 percent since 1983, said David Wray, president of Profit Sharing401k Council of America in Chicago.
The 1.3 percent raise that federal and military retirees will get in January will be the lowest cost-of-living adjustment they've received since 1986, when they also got a 1.3 percent COLA. The increase is official and will first show up in checks received in January. People getting Social Security benefits -- and that includes many federal retirees, too -- will also get the 1.3 percent raise. It reflects the rise in living costs, as measured by the consumer price index between the third quarter of this year July, August and September and the third quarter of 1997. In other words, inflation for that 12-month period rose only 1.3 percent. While many retirees are disappointed with a COLA of only 1.3 percent, most experts say it is a good thing because it means inflation is low and prices are stable. Retirees longing for the good old days of double-digit COLAs forget what double-digit inflation can do to prices on everything from food to cars. In 1979, retirees got a 10.8 percent COLA. In 1980, the COLA was 13.7 percent. And in 1981 the last time retirees got two raises in one year, they got 13.1 percent. That was a period of double-digit inflation. It also was before Congress voted to eliminate the twice-a-year COLAs that some feared would eventually push the cost of civil service retirement higher than payroll costs. Since that time, federal retirees have had to fight regularly and usually with success to get one full COLA a year. There was no COLA adjustment in 1985, and Congress and the White House delayed COLAs for three months paying them in April instead of January in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Workers who retire under the old Civil Service Retirement System get a full COLA each year. Workers who retire under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System are under a diet COLA system. They get a full COLA on the CSRS portion of their annuity. But the FERS portion of their annuity is subject to different rules. For example, if living costs as measured by the CPI are up 2 percent or less, both groups get the same increase. But if the rise in living costs is between 2 and 3 percent, CSRS benefits go up by the full amount, while payments on the FERS portion rise by only 2 percent. If the CPI goes up 3 percent or more, FERS benefits equal the CPI minus 1 percent.
WASHINGTON -- Continued weak exports and strong imports caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to a record level in August. The Commerce Department reported that the trade gap ballooned to 16.77 billion from a seasonally adjusted 14.55 billion in July. The August total was the largest since the department began keeping the numbers in the current format in 1992, and a department analyst estimated that it was probably the biggest since December 1985. Exports in August slipped to an adjusted 74.84 billion from 75.10 billion in July it was the lowest figure since the 73.43 billion in shipments in January 1997. Meanwhile, a growing number of countries continue to ship goods here to try to sell their way out of recession. Imports in August climbed to an adjusted 91.61 billion from 89.65 billion the previous month. Exports were weak across the board, reflecting the spreading economic crisis. The U.S. deficit with Japan, which is mired in recession, swelled to 5.2 billion in August from 4.54 billion a year earlier. The year-over-year comparisons provide the most accurate measurement, since these figures aren't seasonally adjusted. The overall trade deficit with Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, surged to 15.69 billion from 11.65 billion a year earlier. The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil narrowed to 363 million from 535 million a year earlier. The trade deficit with China, which hasn't been as affected by the Asian economic ills as most of its neighbors, also expanded in August. The red ink grew to 5.91 billion from 5.14 billion in August 1997.
SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH will trim budget surpluses, analysts predict. As economic storm clouds darken, economists are cutting budget-surplus estimates for next year. Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch predicts the economy will grow only 1.5, down from an estimated 3.5 this year. Clearly, the budget surplus will be much smaller than advertised, he warns. Corporate tax receipts are already beginning to fall off because of the weakness in corporate earnings. Slower job growth and the stock market's woes also are likely to weigh heavily on income-tax receipts. James Glassman of Chase Securities, a unit of Chase Manhattan, predicts the economy will expand only about 1 or less over the next four quarters, with the federal budget surplus narrowing to 50 billion or less in fiscal 1999 from about 71 billion this year. Donald J. Boyd of the Center for the Study of the States, a unit of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, N.Y., adds There's no question the slowing economic environment will have adverse effects on state finances. Next year, we will see far fewer proposals for state-tax cuts than we have in recent years, Mr. Boyd predicts. SELF-EMPLOYED WORKERS may deduct more of their health-insurance costs.
It seems that postcommunist Russia poses a greater threat to global capitalism than the Soviet Union ever did. The Russian debt default in mid-August has generated financial shock waves that could drive next year's growth rate of the world economy to the lowest level in the postwar era. There are worrying signs that the U.S. will experience a credit crunch in the banking sector that could offset the benefits of lower interest rates. And while the European economy still enjoys moderate growth momentum, it will be highly vulnerable to an export slump if the rest of the world continues to slow. The magnitude of the correction after the Russian default illustrates how profoundly global financial markets have changed as new technology has driven down the cost of trading, hedge funds have gained access to leverage from bankers, and investors have developed an increasing appetite for risk following the long Wall Street boom. In turn, these changes have exposed how vulnerable the global financial system is, and underscored the need for an international lender of last resort. One vulnerability is the remarkable interdependence that has developed among markets because of the growth of global capital flows and the increasing role of highly leveraged investors in allocating capital. In the late 1980s, capital flows to developing countries were less than 50 billion. The Cold War's end and the growth of financial markets in developing countries drove this figure up to more than 300 billion in 1996. There has also been a dramatic expansion in the size of security markets. In the U.S., the ratio of stock-market capitalization to gross domestic product has nearly tripled during the 1990s while the mutual-fund industry now has greater assets than the banking system. The spectacular performance of the U.S. equity market stimulated an appetite for risk among high-income investors that encouraged a proliferation of new hedge funds. According to survey data, the U.S. now has more than 1,200 hedge funds with 200 billion to 300 billion in assets. During the 1990s these funds have become leading players in emerging markets. When Russia defaulted, it did not merely force some hedge funds to liquidate securities in other emerging markets. Instead, it produced such losses that many bankers felt compelled to curtail both their security market and their lending exposure in emerging markets. It also prompted some hedge funds to repay the low-cost yen loans they had taken out to finance security purchases and thus encouraged a large rally in the yen. Before August, few investors would have expected a Russian default to shatter Latin America's access to credit or produce a surge in the value of the yen, but such are the consequences of today's new global financial integration.
Tropicana Products announced it would raise the wholesale price of its orange juices an average of 10 percent because of a sharply reduced Florida orange crop blamed on heavy winter rains and a dry summer and spring. That translates to about 30 cents to 40 cents more for consumers buying 64-ounce and 96-ounce containers. The higher prices will probably start showing up in stores in late November. Minute Maid, Tropicana's chief national competitor in the orange juice market, said it expected to announce a price increase in the near future. A new U.S. savings bond plan will allow Americans to have the costs of the bonds automatically deducted from their bank accounts by the government. The new program, called the EasySaver Plan, is intended to complement the existing payroll deduction plan. Savers will be able to choose the dates they want the Treasury Department to charge their accounts -- a minimum of twice a year. The traditional Series EE bonds, which sell for half their face value, will be available in denominations ranging from 50 to 1,000. Series I bonds, which carry a lower interest rate but are adjusted to reflect inflation, also will be sold, at their full face value, in denominations from 50 to 1,000. Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund taken over by 14 lenders last month, is seeking to refinance soon-to-expire credit lines from banks not involved in the rescue, a person familiar with the fund said. It also fired 18 percent of its staff to cut costs. Credit lines from banks not involved in the takeover financed about 10 percent of Long-Term Capital's 100 billion balance sheet, the source said. Durable goods orders rose 0.9 percent in September, pulled higher by demand for automobiles, communications equipment and military goods. The unexpected fourth consecutive increase brought orders to a seasonally adjusted 192.1 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected about a 1 percent drop, with world financial turmoil diminishing demand for U.S. products. The Treasury sold 16.002 billion of two-year notes at a yield of 4.025 percent, the lowest in five years. Demand was considered subdued, judging by the bidcover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the number of bids to the amount of securities sold. The bidcover ratio was 1.97, showing that there was less demand than at the Treasury's last monthly sale of two-year notes on Sept. 23 when the ratio was 2.39. The yield on the two-year notes sold yesterday was the lowest since 3.94 percent at the Oct. 26, 1993, auction. At the Sept. 23 auction, the notes yielded 4.615 percent.
Walt Disney Co.'s ABC said it won't allow more than 1,000 unionized workers who walked off the job to protest its health-care policy to return to work unless they pledge not to take such action again without first warning the company. The lockout comes in response to the start of a 24-hour strike earlier yesterday by the workers at ABC-TV and ABC Radio. The workers said they walked out because ABC and its parent, Disney, are demanding they drop their current health care coverage and switch to Disney's new Signature plan. The court-appointed officer for the Teamsters election mailed ballots to the union's 1.4 million members, who have one month to choose James P. Hoffa, son of Jimmy Hoffa, or Tom Leedham, head of the union's warehouse division, as the next union president. Hoffa narrowly lost his bid to unseat incumbent Ron Carey in 1996, but the results of that contest were overturned when investigators concluded that Carey's campaign had raised funds illegally. BMC Software of Houston, a maker of network monitoring software, said it will buy rival Boole & Babbage for about 900 million in stock to extend its international business. San Jose-based Boole & Babbage's software helps companies manage and operate computer networks that use different kinds of computers and operating systems. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange begins offering a futures contract today that allows companies to profit from an increase in the number of customers who can't pay their bills. It is targeting lenders in the 1.3 trillion market for consumer credit by basing the contract's value on the number of bankruptcy filings each quarter. SyQuest Technology, once the leader in removable memory storage devices for personal computers, said it has suspended operations and may file for bankruptcy. Analysts blamed the Fremont, Calif.-based company's apparent demise on a shaky business model. They said SyQuest was also hurt by the Asian financial crisis, weak PC sales earlier this year and the expense of expansion amid a disk drive industry downturn.
MINNEAPOLIS -- K-tel International Inc.'s president resigned from his post at the company two months ago, and was succeeded by a relative of K-tel's founder and biggest stockholder. Separately, K-tel's often volatile shares nearly doubled yesterday, soaring 6.375 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, to 13.25. Volume was extremely heavy, with 16.6 million shares changing hands that number represents roughly two times the 8.34 million common of K-tel shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. The stock's surge was spurred by the disclosure yesterday of an agreement between K-tel and Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s online unit, under which they will jointly develop an online music store at Playboy's Internet Web site. The marketer of entertainment and consumer products said 41-year-old David Weiner, who had served as president since 1996, resigned Sept. 4 to pursue other interests. K-tel named as its new president Lawrence Kieves, 50, who was formerly managing director of closely held EWK Associates, a real-estate development concern. Mr. Kieves served previously as chief operating officer of Network Event Theater Inc., a publicly traded campus media and marketing concern. Mr. Kieves, the company noted, is a first cousin, once removed, of K-tel's 69-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, Philip Kives. Mr. Kives, who founded K-tel in 1968, holds about a 42 stake in the company. A K-tel spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the reasons behind Mr. Weiner's departure, and Mr. Weiner couldn't be reached for comment. K-tel's spokeswoman also declined to discuss why the company, although it had previously disclosed the management changes in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, had waited so long before issuing a public statement about the departure of its No. 2 official.
I recently had the privilege of working closely with two men of uncommon courage -- Andrew F. Brimmer, former chair of the D.C. financial control board, and Julius W. Becton Jr., former chief executive officer and superintendent of the D.C. public schools. Before taking up their work in the District, these men had climbed the heights of their chosen professions. Brimmer was one of the leading economists in the United States and a member of the Federal Reserve Board. Becton had retired, after 40 years of service, as a U.S. Army lieutenant general. Both Brimmer and Becton are members of what Thomas Jefferson called that natural aristocracy, based not upon birth but upon virtue and talents. Brimmer and Becton volunteered for arduous and time-consuming positions in our community in a time of troubles. They did this not for recognition, of which each already had received a full measure, but because they hoped to make a difference. And they did make a difference. Brimmer helped put the District on the road to recovery and reform. Changing the city's course was like turning a battleship in a storm, but his firm hand on the helm managed to bring the ship around. Likewise, Becton laid the groundwork for a better school system, which he left to the control of his chosen successor, Arlene Ackerman. The Bible says that a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country. Although neither Becton nor Brimmer would claim the mantle of prophet, each in his own way blazed a trail for others to follow toward a better future for the District. As the Bible also says, men such as these are the glory of their times. They need no defense from me.
OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate declined in October to its lowest level in eight years, dropping to 8.1 from 8.3 in September, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said. The stronger-than-expected October job data eased fears that Canada, the largest foreign customer for U.S. goods, was heading toward an early recession. Many analysts had predicted a rise in the October jobless rate. Alister Smith, deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said the October report was really good, showing job strength across industries and regions. He said the job strength supports the bank's view that the Canadian economy will grow at a rate of about 3 through 1998 before slowing to a pace of about 2 in 1999. Wojciech Szadurski, Bank of Montreal economist, said the latest job gains significantly reduce concern about an imminent recession in Canada. These concerns have been heightened by the economic turmoil in Asia and other regions. Full-time jobs showed a big gain in October, rising 83,900, or 0.7, from September. Manufacturing jobs, after declining for three consecutive months, rose 42,700, or 2, from the previous month. Statistics Canada's latest survey of manufacturers indicated they were more positive about new orders and were planning to increase production in the next three months.
Investors caught their breath after an eight-day Wall Street rampage, pushing stocks down and bonds up in what many traders viewed as a temporary pause in the stock rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 77.50, or 0.86, to 8897.96. Sharp gains by technology stocks including Dell Computer and Internet-related stocks pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index up 4.49, or 0.24, to 1861.05. Treasury bonds bounced back after taking a beating during last week's push toward stocks, and the dollar gained. The 30-year bellwether Treasury bond gained 1 1332, or 14.0625 per 1,000 bond, pulling the yield which moves opposite to the price back to 5.288. The bond market and most banks are closed tomorrow for Veterans Day, although the stock market remains open. It was a light-volume day where you just saw some profit-taking in stocks, said Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber. William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, noted that bond investors worried last week that the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates this month he said that worry spread to stock investors this week.
GOLDEN, Colo. -- Atlas Air Inc., which provides freight flights for airlines, is expected to announce an agreement today to fly three Boeing 747 jumbo jet cargo planes for Federal Express Corp. The outsourcing deal, valued at more than 30 million in annual revenue for Atlas, is believed to be part of FedEx's strategy to restructure operations to reduce reliance on its own pilots. By contracting some international shipping to low-cost Atlas, FedEx risks further rankling its higher-paid pilots during contentious contract negotiations. Federal Express, a unit of FDX Corp., Memphis, Tenn., declined to comment. Atlas, a six-year-old concern that founder Michael A. Chowdry has built into the world's largest operator of 747 freighters, said service for FedEx would begin in the fourth quarter. Atlas will provide two 747-400 freighters, a 747-200 cargo plane plus crews, maintenance and insurance. The company declined to say how long the FedEx contract would last. Last year, Atlas provided two planes for extra seasonal lift to FedEx in the fourth quarter and, in 1996, provided one plane for FedEx.
What a difference a month makes. In July, consumer confidence reached a 29-year high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at an all-time high, unemployment rates plumbed 28-year lows, and the dollar grew stronger against virtually every currency on earth. By late August consumer confidence was down, as was the dollar, and a growing number of economists were forecasting recession in 1999. Yet no sooner had the doomsayers spoken then the Dow rebounded and the economic outlook brightened once again. Volatile markets will always be with us. But what's of real concern is the increasingly volatile and self-contradictory nature of our economic policies. The Federal Reserve, shifting abruptly from the inflation front to the recession front, has cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point and revved up monetary growth rates beyond nearly all targeted growth ranges. Yet undermining this new tack are constrictive fiscal policies -- higher taxes and burgeoning regulations -- which virtually guarantee that output cannot keep pace with the money supply. If previous business cycles are any guide, the result will almost certainly be a return of inflation and the end of the steady-growth economy. Fiscal and regulatory policies today are particularly burdensome. Taxes consume 42 of personal income, and regulations cost 10 of gross domestic product. The federal tax code has grown from 11,400 words when it was conceived in 1913 to 555 million words today. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, which like so many of its predecessors was billed as a tax-code simplifier, actually created 824 amendments and added 285 new sections to the existing code. It requires an estimated 60 million hours of extra work by taxpayers, creates 18 new tax forms and revises 230 existing forms. As Mark Twain said, History may not repeat itself, but it sure rhymes. What measures might be taken to synchronize fiscal and monetary policies into a pro-growth, price-stabilizing mode Years ago, Milton Friedman recommended putting the Fed on automatic pilot, meaning that it should create money at a steady rate of 3 to 5, consistent with the estimated long-term growth potential of real output. In revisiting this guide, it is especially helpful to recall that in its 84-year history the Fed has tended to be reactive rather than pre-emptive. Its sudden midcourse corrections have merely amplified the swings of the business cycle.
ATLANTA -- HBO & Co., preparing to be acquired by McKesson Corp., said one of its top executives, Jay P. Gilbertson, resigned to pursue other opportunities. Shares of HBO, a supplier of software to the health-care industry, fell sharply on the news. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, HBO closed at 22.875, down 2.3125. McKesson, a drug wholesaler based in San Francisco, agreed last month to acquire HBO in a stock swap currently valued at about 11.5 billion. In New York Stock Exchange Friday composite trading, McKesson closed at 70.375, down 1.3125. At HBO, Mr. Gilbertson served as co-president, co-chief operating officer and chief financial officer. McKesson and HBO had said he would play an important role in the combined company as a member of a new operating committee of eight executives, a McKesson spokesman said. But he said Richard H. Hawkins, McKesson's current chief financial officer, would retain that role in the new company, to be called McKesson HBOC. Mr. Gilbertson couldn't be reached for comment. The McKesson spokesman said the two companies wanted to retain Mr. Gilbertson, but added His departure should not have a significant impact on our business. HBO said Albert J. Bergonzi, also a co-president, would assume Mr. Gilbertson's duties. Ben Rooks, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, said the stock market seemed to be overreacting to Mr. Gilbertson's departure. I'm not surprised he's leaving, Mr. Rooks said. I'm a little surprised by the timing. But Anthony Vendetti, an analyst at Gruntal & Co., said the resignation raised questions about who's going to be minding the store at HBO.
Things are better in the bond markets, but maybe not good enough for the Federal Reserve, which meets tomorrow to set the future of interest rates. Traders and investors in various parts of the bond market have had much to cheer in recent days. Liquidity, or the ease of trading, has substantially improved in many sectors since the Fed cut interest rates Oct. 15. And the difference in yields between risky bonds and safer Treasurys has narrowed, indicating investors feel more comfortable with riskier assets, helping to avert what seemed like a looming credit crunch. Issuance of corporate bonds is suddenly back on track, highlighted by Sprint Corp.'s sale of 5 billion in bonds last week, the second-biggest corporate-bond deal on record. The issuance followed the successful sale of 4.8 billion of bonds by Associates Corp. of North America, a unit of Associates First Capital Corp., on Oct. 27. Meanwhile, money began to flow in the past two weeks into high-yield and emerging-market bond funds, which could lead to higher bond prices -- and thus, lower yields -- in the months ahead. In addition to the vast improvements in the credit markets, Friday's reports of stronger-than-expected increases in retail sales and producer prices make it less likely the Fed will cut interest rates when it meets tomorrow.
WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration is delivering a mixed economic message to Asia this week Boost your ailing economies through trade liberalization, but don't export so much that it hurts U.S. companies and their workers. And the trade message is bound to be diminished because of President Clinton's absence from a leaders' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Wednesday because of the Iraqi confrontation. Vice President Al Gore will be attending in Mr. Clinton's place. If I were still in the administration, I'd be throwing up over this issue, Robert Litan, a former Clinton economic official who now directs economic studies at the Brookings Institution here, says of the contradictory trade signals. As a free trader, it would make me sick to my stomach. Many of the president's advisers also have heartburn managing fallout from the Asian financial crisis. At the same time that Vice President Gore will be lecturing Asian leaders to cut tariffs and reform their economies, the Commerce Department is helping the U.S. steel industry to fend off Asian imports. Later in the week, if the Iraqi crisis ebbs, Mr. Clinton plans to fly to Japan and South Korea, in part to press the steelmakers' complaints. The administration's economic officials argue that unless they can protect American workers from surging imports caused by Asian countries anxious to boost their economies, congressional support for easing trade barriers -- already tenuous -- will collapse. Even though such efforts undermine U.S. free-trade proselytizing, the administration says it has no alternative.
After several years of relatively flat health-insurance costs, U.S. businesses are starting to be hit with a startling increase in premiums -- and small businesses are being whacked the hardest. Premium increases in health-policy renewal notices for 1999 are running as high as 50 for some small companies, according to benefits consultants. Even medium and large companies are seeing rises of about 5, after flat or even declining health costs in the past few years. Thirty days ago, the average increase already was 14 to 15, and just since then, the average has moved into the high-teens -- and it's not uncommon now to see increases of 30 to 50, said James Mueller, president of the employee-benefits group of Frank Haack & Associates, a Milwaukee-based health-insurance broker. For large companies, the rise in premiums isn't nearly as painful. According to health-care consultants, the most aggressively managed health plans at large companies are seeing annual increases of between 4 and 5, after flat increases last year. But overall, says Edwin Hustead, senior vice president of Hay Group, a benefits consulting firm, insurers probably are going to be asking for rate increases of 6 to 7 or as much as around 10 for 1999. And a recent survey of Fortune 500 benefits managers by BT Alex. Brown found that they expect an average 10.3 increase in premiums for health-maintenance-organization coverage. That compares with an average increase of 5.9 for 1998. Small companies have always been hit harder than large companies by healthcare inflation, largely because their tiny employment bases pose much greater actuarial risks to insurers. In large companies, the costs of sudden medical events is spread over hundreds or thousands of workers. But in a small company, if just a few employees bear children at the same time, for example, the increased cost to the insurer for medical and hospital expenses, in percentage terms, could be enormous, and insurers try to recover those costs through large premium increases.
EUROPE Alitalia Forecasts Sharp Rebound As Sale Nears As Italy moves closer to privatizing Alitalia, the nation's flag carrier is apparently making significant progress on several fronts. The airline yesterday announced that it expects its earnings to be up sharply for the full year and that it plans to invest 4.3 trillion lire 2.6 billion over the next few years to buy 23 jetliners and update its information technology. But the most impressive figures to potential future investors have got be what the carrier, which saw third-quarter sales jump 5 and is set to be privatized within months, is doing to improve its balance sheet. It has cut debt to 15 of capital in the first half, from 89 at the end of last year, and is continuing to trim its bloated payroll. The airline's stock is also benefiting from the fact that Italy and the U.S. recently struck a preliminary deal to boost the number of flights between the two countries and free ticket prices from government control.
They bought like crazy. They sold like crazy. And for a tense 15 minutes leading up to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut, investors froze. Then they bought again, sold off again and called it a day. I can't take the stress anymore, barked Bob Basel, chief trader at Salomon Smith Barney, after the Dow Jones industrial average rode a roller coaster to an 8986.28 close -- down 24.97 points, or 0.3 percent. The average of 30 blue-chip firms had been frozen -- down about 60 points -- until shortly after 215 p.m., when the Fed announcement came. There was this sort of jump ball as to whether the rate cut would come or not, said Ed McMahon, head of U.S. trading for Merrill Lynch. The Fed said it would cut two key interest rates -- and within 15 minutes the Dow jumped nearly 100 points, but it then bobbed up and down for the remainder of the afternoon. Day traders seeking a quick profit were out in full force, traders said, and some large computerized sell-offs kicked in during the final minutes of trading, plunging the Dow into negative territory. The cut was significant because it confirms that the Fed is prepared to do whatever it has to do to maintain liquidity and keep the market's momentum going, said Mary Farrell, an equity strategist at Paine Webber. They have restored rationality in the market.
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS rose 54.83 points to 9041.11, their highest close since July 22, as cautious optimism followed Tuesday's interest-rate cut. The Nasdaq Composite climbed as well. Meanwhile, crude-oil futures dipped below 12 a barrel for the first time since June before recovering slightly. December crude closed at 12.14 a barrel, down 31 cents. --- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a jump in sales of U.S.-made aircraft and autos. But economists don't expect such sales to continue, suggesting the deficit will resume its record-setting pace. --- Consumers will pay more for PCs and see less innovation if Microsoft's Windows monopoly is unchecked, an economist hired by the government testified in the antitrust trial.
Tuesday's quarter-point cut in U.S. interest rates continued to underpin a rally in many of the world's stock markets, driving the Dow Jones World Stock Index up 0.34 point, or 0.18, to 189.36. Stocks in Asia and the Americas, in particular, welcomed the rate cut as likely paving the way for lower domestic interest rates in emerging markets. Hong Kong initially rallied 2, but gave up a lot of the gains to end just 0.6 higher. Elsewhere, the Philippines was up 2.3, Indonesia up 3.9, Singapore up 2.9, and Japan up 1.3. In the Americas, Brazil continued its rallying streak to close up 2.6, benefiting from last week's news of a big financial rescue package and Tuesday's U.S. rate cut. The Bank of Canada yesterday followed the Fed's easing with a cut in its key rate, but the move failed to inspire Canadian stocks, which rose just 0.1. European markets ended mixed, with Sweden up 1.9, Switzerland up 0.9 and France up 0.3, while decliners included Germany, down 0.4, and London, down 0.5. In Asia on Thursday, Tokyo closed the morning session down 0.5, while South Korea was up 0.9 at midday. In early dealings, Indonesia had jumped 1.7, Hong Kong had gained about 1, but Malaysia was down 1.3.
Stocks shot higher today as a late surge gave the Dow Jones industrial average another triple-digit increase and left the blue-chip index just 178 points off its record high. The Dow rose 103.50 to 9159.55, giving it a 239.96-point increase for the week, which was dominated by the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to lower interest rates by one-quarter percentage point. Just six weeks ago, the market had slid below 7500 as investors worried about the world economy. The Dow is now up about 1,275 points for the year, and within sight of its 9337.97 record high reached July 17. Stocks pushed higher in many sectors, from drugs to the Internet to telecommunication services. The technology-laden Nasdaq index and broader stock indicators also rose. Banks and financial services stocks were among the front-runners as investors grew more confident that lower interest rates will boost the economy with more borrowing and spending.
Is there a Santa Claus on the World Wide Web This may be the first e-Christmas, a recent article in this newspaper speculated. The current cover of Fortune depicts the Internet as a rainbow -- with, one must assume, a pot of gold at the end. Here's a reality check. This summer an Internet trade magazine asked some technically savvy employees to create an Internet store selling baseball books. The result In two months they had five orders, totaling 76.75. In all, excluding labor but including advertising, the sites cost them 485. E-commerce isn't fast and it isn't easy, reported the chastened publication. And these techies did everything right. They knew to register and reregister with the right search engines they knew how to wrestle with service bugs they knew to link to other sites and how to design banner advertisements they knew to sell baseball books during baseball season. Still they flopped. If people who know what they're doing can't make money on the Web, who can So far the answer is almost no one. A Morgan Stanley e-commerce study from last year found that the top 10 Internet sites got 50 of the advertising revenue. The top 100 sites got almost 95 of the revenue. So who is making money As in past gold rushes, it is the people who were there first, like Amazon.com, whose stock split 3-to-1 last week. Also doing well are sharpies selling maps and pickaxes. The Internet map makers have various guises, including search engines like Yahoo and AltaVista, as well as market researchers like Jupiter Communications and Forrester Research. Many a fanciful business plan has been launched using numbers from Internet market researchers, yet they know little more than anyone else. But without maps, online businesses are nowhere -- thus many map-makers are profitable. The Internet is a little bit recession proof, opined David C. Peterschmidt recently from his vantage as CEO of Inktomi Corporation, a search company. And he cheerfully added, Every time somebody hits the search button, our cash register rings.
NEW YORK -- The bond market got the holiday-shortened week off to a poor start, as investors moved money out of Treasurys and into stocks and corporate bonds. Long-maturity Treasurys saw the biggest declines while shorter-dated issues registered only minimal losses. In trading late yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 2232 point, or 6.875 for a bond with 1,000 face value, at 99 2532. Its yield rose to 5.256 from 5.215 late Friday, as bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Selling pressure on long-maturity Treasurys was compounded by the record high reached by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 214.72 points, at 9374.27 -- topping its closing of 9337.97 on July 17 and marking the first time in four months the industrial average has surpassed the 9300-point mark. The continued heavy issuance of corporate bonds also drew money out of Treasurys. The most notable bond deal was pharmaceutical company Merck & Co.'s 500 million 30-year bond.
Stock prices having more than bounced back from their post-Russia lows, we are being told once more by various authorities that the market is wrong. Maybe the hordes of small investors are simply processing the available information better than the pros. What might the non-chumps who have started putting money into stock funds again know Their jobs are secure, wages are rising, and their employers are doing well. Heading out to do their shopping, they experience the joy of finding that prices, if anything, are a bit lower than last time. Harder to put a finger on but palpable nonetheless, there is something distinctly less crappy about the goods for sale. The clothes are made from natural fabrics, the appliances have computer chips in them, the cars never seem to break down. What else does our shmoe know Downsizing gave him a rough ride, and wisecracks about the boss's stock options are a standard water-cooler hors d'oeurve. But somehow the company does seem more focused and disciplined No more drifting in the clouds of wishful thinking, executive vanity and bureaucratic inertia. So his boss is keener on earning a profit, and his dollars are worth more down at the Wal-Mart, Home Depot or Price Chopper. What does this mean for the shmoe's stock funds
NEW YORK -- U.S. bankers have blown it again. They lost millions in Russian Treasury bills. They got creamed on Asian securities. They loaned too much to hedge funds. They're at risk -- again -- in Latin America. When will they learn In fact, bankers have learned a lot this decade. While their earnings may be bruised and their growth prospects may be slowing, the nation's banks are in far better shape today than they were the last time the economy showed signs of slowing down. That will almost surely mean a softer landing when the next recession strikes. It was less than a decade ago that U.S. banks seemed mired in their worst crisis since the Great Depression. Big international banks lost hundreds of millions in real-estate and Latin American loans during the 1980s. Dozens of small banks failed in Texas and New England, deepening the recession in those places. These days, U.S. banks are awash in capital. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission even put heat recently on SunTrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta for stockpiling reserves to boost earnings during a slowdown.
The stock market, up. Consumer confidence, up. Job growth, up. The planets seem aligned for a burst of holiday shopping indulgence that should pump more than 5 billion into the Washington area economy in November and December. It's going to be better than we were expecting just a few weeks ago, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., which tracks the region's economic performance. Holiday spending on items sold in malls and shops, through catalogues and on the Internet will exceed last year's total by more than 5 percent, predicted Mark P. Vitner, chief economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte. In the Washington region, that translates into roughly 250 million in additional sales over 1997 -- equivalent to a year's revenue for a good-size technology company. Earlier this year, the National Retail Federation had predicted a 5 percent to 6 percent increase in spending over last year's holiday season. When the stock market briefly turned turtle this summer, that forecast looked shaky.
EXXON AGREED to buy Mobil for stock valued at about 75.3 billion, creating an energy giant in the largest takeover ever and marking an era of low inflation. The deal is likely to attract close antitrust scrutiny, and the two companies face the task of integrating different corporate cultures. Meanwhile, the CBOE is investigating premerger options trading in Mobil. Lower oil prices will offer U.S. consumers extra purchasing power, while airlines, railroads, and other companies will reap a windfall. January crude fell nine cents to 11.13 a barrel at the New York Merc, a 12-year low. --- Boeing announced sharp production cutbacks for almost every jetliner model and the elimination of as many as 20,000 additional jobs through 2000, as it acknowledged the impact of Asia's problems on its strategy. ---
Nasdaq is bidding farewell to a growing number of Florida's smaller stocks. Many of the state's stocks have long called the Nasdaq Stock Market their home without much fear of eviction unless they filed for bankruptcy protection. But now, that's changing as many of Florida's mostly little companies find that they can't meet the more-stringent standards -- including a 1 minimum bid price and heightened governance rules -- imposed this year by Nasdaq on its main National Market and lower-profile SmallCap Market. In the first 10 months of the year, an estimated 42 Florida companies have been booted from either the Nasdaq National Market or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market for their inability to meet the new qualifications, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. That's about 18 of the state's Nasdaq stocks and roughly double the national average. The figures include companies that weren't deleted from Nasdaq altogether, but found a home on the SmallCap Market, which, despite its own stricter requirements, is more hospitable to companies with modest market values. It could get worse in Florida. The summer's stampede out of small-caps has turned off some prospective investors and contributed to shrinking share prices. Of the more than 230 Florida stocks on the National and SmallCap markets, about 10 traded for less than 1 as of Nov. 20, meaning they are at risk for getting demoted or kicked out. Nearly 45, or more than 100, of these Nasdaq stocks are below the 5 mark, making them vulnerable, too, because they don't have far to fall.
The Japanese government announced today that the world's second-largest economy continued to shrink for an unprecedented fourth quarter in the three months that ended in September, despite a boost from government spending. In addition, the government announced that for the first time in its history, the value of the national and local governments' debts will exceed the nation's total economic output at the end of this fiscal year. Basically there is no recovery in sight, said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, an economist with the Industrial Bank of Japan. The United States and other nations have urged Japan to revive its economy as fears mount that Japan's woes could prolong economic turmoil in Asia and threaten the rest of the global economy. Japan's gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- contracted 0.7 percent in the July-September period, for an annual rate of 2.6 percent.
The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent last month, as stronger-than-expected hiring by builders, retailers, restaurants and other service providers more than offset layoffs by manufacturers, the government reported yesterday. The gain of 267,000 payroll jobs in November, which was much greater than many analysts had anticipated, showed that the nation's labor markets remained strong despite the recent flurry of corporate layoff announcements. Boeing Co., Johnson & Johnson, Merrill Lynch & Co. and merging oil companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are among the corporate giants that have recently announced plans to slash tens of thousands of jobs. But many of those cuts won't occur for months or years. Meanwhile, other payrolls are booming. The U.S. growth story remains a tale of two economies, with the manufacturing sector shedding 47,000 jobs in November, purchasing agents reporting the weakest factory conditions since February 1996 and new factory orders dropping in October, said Bill Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York. More than compensating for those job losses were a jump of 55,000 jobs at firms providing business services, including temporary help, and of 47,000 in construction. Unusually strong holiday hiring boosted retail trade employment by 65,000 jobs, the Labor Department said.
It's a part of the country's social fabric that is as American as motherhood and apple pie homeownership. Sociologists and economists alike have praised the value of homeownership, because of its beneficial effects on crime and neighborhood stability as well as its stimulative effect on the economy. Housing has a tremendous impact on the economy, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis. People have said one out of every six jobs in America is housing or related industries. The largest user of copper in the world, or at least in America, is housing. The demand for lumber, aluminum, carpets, all these things are affected by housing. Right now, that demand is sky high, helping the economy by offsetting some of the drop in demand for exports from ailing Asian economies. That's because the percentage of Americans owning their own homes is at an all-time high of 66.8 percent, as the chart at right shows. That's an increase from the 1997 rate of 65.7 percent, which broke a record set back in 1980, when the rate stood at 65.6 percent. Not surprisingly, housing experts credit the strong economic combination of low inflation and low interest rates for the high ownership rate -- which has risen almost a point from the start of the year. A point may not seem like a lot, but it translates to about 1 million additional homeowners.
WASHINGTON -- Christmas may not be as merry as some retailers hoped. As the economy slowed in several parts of the country, retail sales in the past six weeks were weaker than retailers expected, according to the Federal Reserve's latest survey of regional economic conditions. There were some bright spots Discount department stores showed strong growth in sales. And on the day after Thanksgiving, regarded as the biggest shopping day of the year, sales rose modestly from a year earlier. But in the Boston area, for example, most retailers reported that sales were clearly slowing, the report said. And Christmas has started slowly in and around San Francisco, where sales were mixed. In the Atlanta district, sales were flat. Some retailers were concerned that consumers may pull back during the holiday season, the report said. But others are counting on more traditional weather conditions to arrive and drive shoppers from the parks back into the malls. Retailers also said the tight labor market is making it difficult to recruit and maintain qualified workers for the holiday rush. Some retailers in the Cleveland district said they are paying seasonal employees as much as 25 more than last year.
WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service picked a team of companies led by Computer Sciences Corp. to take over the agency's bungled computer-modernization program. The multibillion-dollar project, expected to stretch over more than a decade, could become the biggest nondefense contract ever awarded by the federal government and is one of the most prestigious. For the troubled tax collector, the award marks a sharp about-face. The IRS will rely for the first time on the private sector to update its aged computer system, abandoning numerous efforts to do so internally, even when it clearly lacked the expertise. For taxpayers, the IRS insists, the system designed by CSC of El Segundo, Calif., will finally make gaining access to personal records and reaching agency officials by phone as easy as dealing with a bank or credit-card company -- though they caution that goal will still take years to reach. The IRS needs to break out of its technological time warp from the 1950s and 1960s, Commissioner Charles Rossotti said in a statement. This new partnership will help us replace archaic technology with the modern tools we need. . . . This marriage of the private and public sectors offers the best approach, he added. Yesterday's announcement was also a huge victory for CSC -- an information-technology, consulting, and outsourcing giant -- which bested a rival group headed by Lockheed Martin Corp. of Bethesda, Md., in the yearlong competition for the project. With revenue last fiscal year of 6.6 billion, CSC is less than one-third the size of Lockheed Martin. CSC officials said the IRS award could end up as the largest contract the firm has ever won.
J.P. Morgan & Co., still buffeted by this fall's tumultuous markets, said it would take a pretax charge of 100 million in the fourth quarter because of cost-cutting, and warned that operating earnings for the quarter would be weaker than those of the third quarter. The forecast of weaker earnings is another sign that global markets are still a drag on corporate performance despite the resurgence of the stock market. The nation's fourth-largest bank attributed the expected quarterly shortfall to reduced revenue in its proprietary equity investments and trading, activities which were slammed during the roller-coaster markets of September and October. The disclosure hit the company's shares, which dropped 2.375 to close at 104.1875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. But J.P. Morgan said both the number of clients and revenue from many investment-banking activities had picked up during the quarter. J.P. Morgan recently has been an agent or adviser on several high-profile deals, including the advice it provided in the 75.3 billion merger of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. Our position is strong going into the new year as markets recover, said a company spokesman. The charge relates to J.P. Morgan's continuing cost-cutting plan. The company previously said it planned to cut about 5 of its employees, or roughly 740 people, during the fourth quarter in piecemeal fashion. J.P. Morgan, which has been hampered by high costs in recent years, has said it plans to cut 400 million in core expenses in 1999, while reinvesting at least 100 million in additional savings it expects from cost cuts.
Consumer prices barely budged last month as moderation in food and energy costs kept inflation under wraps. In good news for holiday shoppers, the price of computers, video equipment and toys all declined. The consumer price index edged up just 0.2 percent in November, matching the October increase, the Labor Department reported yesterday. So far this year, inflation is rising at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent, even better than last year's 11-year low of 1.7 percent. Inflation remains benign, said Paul Kasriel, chief domestic economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. But while consumers are reaping benefits, Kasriel said domestic industries are being caught in a profit squeeze. Their labor costs are rising but they don't have the ability because of foreign competition to raise their prices to maintain profit margins, he said.
The New York Stock Exchange struck an agreement with the city and state of New York to build its first major new facility in a century while staying in its historic lower-Manhattan neighborhood. The city and state are putting up a record 560 million in subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits to build a 60-story office tower, including a state-of-the-art trading facility, across from the Big Board's current home at Broad and Wall streets. The long-expected agreement is critical to both city and exchange. The stock exchange gets vital space to add more foreign stocks and trading technology, while the city and state retain the institution that defines the New York City financial district, which has only recently recovered from the early 1990s real-estate recession. But the deal also carries risks for both sides. The Big Board, by far the world's biggest stock market, is prospering now, but its open outcry system of trading stocks on a physical floor faces serious challenges from electronic-trading systems. Such systems have prompted many foreign markets to scrap their floors entirely. And though it is the financial district's first new office tower in 10 years, signs of a slowing economy have made speculative new construction risky, and some projects are already being called off around the country. The agreement, announced jointly yesterday by the state, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Big Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Grasso, is subject to a more definitive agreement and to approval by the exchange's board. Under the deal, the city and state will acquire a site across Broad Street now primarily occupied by J.P. Morgan & Co. and find a developer to build the tower.
A Maryland governor's task force will recommend that the state give an extra 22 million to the University of Maryland at College Park over the next two years and guarantee at least 5,000 in funds per student to each of the University of Maryland system's 13 campuses. In a report to be delivered to Gov. Parris N. Glendening D next month, the panel will urge the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the University System of Maryland to create a statewide funding strategy for higher education that will help College Park realize its intended status as flagship and set mandatory minimum funding levels for the system's colleges and universities, which saw state funding stagnate during the recession of the early 1990s. The funding guarantees will give university presidents a built- in, reliable component to their budgets . . . so they can project what programs they can take care of, said Del. Nancy K. Kopp D- Montgomery, the task force co-chairman. The task force's recommendations recognize College Park's need for additional funds to compete for staff and students with top-ranked public universities elsewhere. When the University System of Maryland was created in 1988, lawmakers called for an increase of 20 million a year for College Park from 1990 to 1995 to put it on par with top public universities in California, North Carolina, Michigan and Illinois.
Bucking dire predictions about the effects of impeachment, declining earnings and sky-high price-to-earnings ratios, the stock market has risen for the past six sessions in a row and could return more than 30 percent in 1999. In fact, the four years that come to a close this Thursday may be the best in history. Throughout this bull market, naysayers have fretted about lofty valuations, but stocks have simply climbed higher. Today, for example, the PE ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the best proxy for the broad market, is an astronomical 32, compared with an average of 19 over the past 12 years. Could it be that prominent pessimists -- such as Robert Shiller of Yale and John Campbell of Harvard, who said two years ago with the Dow at 6382 that stocks were at unsustainable heights, and the Economist magazine, which seems almost to be cheering for a crash -- are drawing conclusions from an antiquated model of the market It seems so. With a colleague, economist Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, I have been working for the past year on a book that offers an explanation for the fabulous returns of recent years. We argue that stocks are moving now to correct a state of perennial undervaluation and that this strong upward trend will continue. Our analysis is pretty technical, but it begins with a fact that economists have known for years Over the long term, stocks are no more risky than bonds. Stocks and bonds should logically provide roughly the same returns, but stocks return far more -- an average of 11 percent a year, compared with just 5 percent for bonds.
ASIAPACIFIC South Korea Hits A Snag in Overhaul Of Conglomerates Controversy erupted in South Korea over the proposed merger between Hyundai Electronics Industry and LG Semicon when the latter vowed to fight the transaction. LG Semicon's announcement Thursday came after U.S. consulting company Arthur D. Little chose Hyundai to take a controlling stake in the new entity. LG Semicon, a central unit of the country's fourth-largest conglomerate, LG Group, wouldn't say how it plans to nullify the decision, but analysts say the company probably will appeal to public sentiment, lobby government officials, sell some of its equity to foreign investors and accumulate more cash. The company is expected to argue that it is able to remain independent. It appears that LG Group is on a collision course with the government now, an electronics analyst at Dongwon Securities said.
Japan's floundering economy has crossed another humiliating milestone Its official unemployment rate is as high as America's for the first time since Tokyo started keeping such statistics 45 years ago. The Japanese government said Friday that its jobless rate, which averaged 2.5 in the 1980s, rose in November to a record 4.4 from 4.3 in October, matching the U.S. rate for the same period, announced a few weeks ago. This once-unthinkable development -- reported in banner headlines in the Friday-evening editions of five national Japanese daily newspapers -- is the latest manifestation of a decade in which nearly everything has gone wrong for the Japanese economy and so much has gone right for the U.S. Japan is suffering its longest downturn since the country was reduced to rubble during World War II. The U.S. is enjoying the longest peacetime expansion in its history. The U.S. has always had a lot of unemployment this is frightening, says Shuhei Oshima, a 26-year employee of an insurance agency in Tokyo. Says 48-year-old housewife Masako Torii, her eyes widening, What's happening to all the things we believe in The bankruptcy of her husband's small printing company has forced her to seek full-time work, so far unsuccessfully, for the first time since she got married 25 years ago. The fact that it has taken so long to bring the two jobless rates together testifies to the durability of Japan Inc.'s famous commitment to employment security. Despite severe economic distress, major Japanese companies still hesitate to cut workers. In contrast, U.S. companies from Polaroid Corp. on the East Coast to Northrop Grumman Corp. on the West Coast have announced major layoffs this month amid the strongest economy in a generation.
The recipe seems too easy Make widget, sell widget, add Web site. Stock prices for a growing number of companies are soaring on the burgeoning enthusiasm about the Internet and online shopping. Since November, brisk holiday sales on the World Wide Web have sent investors hunting for any company looking to expand its presence on the popular medium. The impact has been felt in just about every, and any, Internet-related stock. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Internet Index set a new high Monday at 426.96 and has doubled since mid-October. Yesterday the index was down 11.4 to 415.56. The market capitalization of Charles Schwab, which owns the largest online broker, jumped over securities behemoth Merrill Lynch this week. And after the close tomorrow, as previously announced, America Online will join the blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, further raising the demand for the Internet-service provider's shares. What's more, a number of obscure small stocks are surging on the news of Web efforts. Heavyweight motorcycle manufacturer Bikers Dream more than doubled to 6 2732 on the Nasdaq Stock Market as news reports about the company's planned Internet sales channel spread. Catalog specialty-retailer SkyMall has tripled since Christmas, after it announced faster-than-expected sales growth on its Web site. And Active Apparel Group, a tiny sportswear manufacturer, has increased by a factor of 15 after reporting new Internet retailing links. Yesterday, the New York company's stock rose 7 12, or 65, to 19. A lot of stocks are moving up on announcements of interest in e-tailing, says Keith Benjamin, Internet analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens. Fine-art auctioneer Sotheby's, for example, jumped 6 this month when a Merrill Lynch analyst mentioned the company's Internet prospects. Retailer Sharper Image's Web site was mentioned in news reports after Thanksgiving, helping the stock to an all-time high of 21 316 Nov. 30.
Crowning the Jesse Unruh State Building, across the street from the Capitol in Sacramento, an inscription declares Bring Me Men to Match My Mountains. Well, the men who have led California may not always have echoed the inspiring majesty of the Sierras or the rugged power of the Tehachapis. But like it or not, the governors of modern California have been almost perfectly matched to their times. The thoughtful Pat Brown, elected in 1958, earnestly believed in an expansive future, devoting himself to the transportation and education systems that would undergird the California economy. When things seemed to be moving too fast and too far, voters in 1966 replaced Mr. Brown with Ronald Reagan, who promised a return to the homespun values he made famous in his black-and-white movies. His successor in 1974, Jerry Brown, seemed to embody the ambiguity of the '70s, simultaneously preaching lowered expectations and iconoclastic -- some thought reckless -- innovation. Straight-arrow George Deukmejian saw California through the conformist 1980s, while ex-Marine Pete Wilson marched the state past recession and retrenchment in the early '90s. So what does the landslide election of Gray Davis -- by any account, California's big winner of 1998 -- tell us about our own time After all, Mr. Davis seems best defined by what he lacks in comparison to his predecessors -- that is, the vision of the elder Mr. Brown, the charisma of Mr. Reagan, the audacity of Mr. Brown Jr., the certitude of Mr. Deukmejian, the pugnacity of Mr. Wilson. But for all the talk of how apt Mr. Davis's first name is, the new governor does seem to personify the cautious optimism with which California looks to the next millennium. Great calamities have befallen the state in the not-so-distant past, but the resolute way Californians rebuilt after earthquake and riot and recession proved that fundamental strengths remained to be -- and, indeed, should be -- tapped. To the steady Mr. Davis falls the task of harnessing those strengths -- without exhausting them. Of course, for every winner, there is a loser. For this year, on the flip side of Mr. Davis's victory was the California Republican Party, which lost not only the governor's office, but also the statewide posts of attorney general and treasurer, seats in both houses of the Legislature and the campaign against Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. This doubtless leaves the state GOP feeling confused and out-of-touch -- as the Democrats once did.
Some mutual-fund companies may make changes to year-end fund prices after a trading glitch caused several companies to publish inaccurate data in recent days. Yesterday, the Nasdaq Stock Market, which provides the price listings used by newspapers for more than 10,000 mutual funds, sent a memo to U.S. mutual-fund companies asking them to make any necessary changes to their year-end prices. The move came after a number of fund companies, including giant Fidelity Investments, experienced problems publishing accurate share prices for funds that held the stock of America Online Inc., which experienced year-end price swings on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the last trading day of 1998. The swings caused confusion among mutual funds over the closing price for AOL that day. The problems affected several wellknown funds, including Fidelity's Magellan Fund. In pricing shares of funds that held stock of the Internet company, several fund outfits initially used an incorrect, lower closing price for AOL when distributing per-share fund data to outlets for publication in newspapers and other uses. As a result, the price that mutual-fund buyers were charged to purchase funds that held AOL stock was actually higher than the too-low price that appeared in their newspaper fund listings. In a memo to fund companies, Nasdaq called on fund groups that may have a problem to correct the closing net-asset value of funds for 1998. The problem, Nasdaq officials say, is that end-of-year information is important in determining mutual-fund rankings and even tax issues that affect small investors.
Corrections & Amplifications TOTAL RETURNS for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reported in the Quarterly Mutual Funds Review on Jan. 7 were preliminary figures. The final figures are 1998 fourth-quarter total return, 21.30 one-year total return, 28.58 three-year total return, 28.23 five-year total return, 24.06 10-year total return, 19.21. In addition, the cumulative five-year total return was 193.91. The preliminary figures were provided by Lipper Inc. A table accompanying a Jan. 15 article on retirement-fund investing included some of these preliminary figures and wrongly indicated they were final figures provided by Morningstar Inc. WSJ Jan. 28, 1999 Wrapping up a year in which stock prices surged, swooned and then soared once more, diversified U.S.-stock funds ended 1998 with an average 14.52 total return. That 1998 gain, as calculated by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J., is higher than many market watchers had expected at the beginning of the year -- and is right in line with the impressive 14.49 average annual gain for U.S.-stock funds over the past 15 years. But the 1998 advance was smaller than 1997's 24.36 average fund return and also lagged behind the 1998 gains of some widely watched market benchmarks. The strong if unspectacular year-end number for stock funds obscures the high drama of mutual-fund investing in 1998.
Thanks to so-called being there raises, tens of thousands of civil servants will get an extra 3 percent in their paychecks later this year on top of the automatic 3.68 percent adjustment that goes into effect this month. The paycheck sweeteners are technically known as step increases, or within grade raises within the federal family. Each General Schedule pay grade has 10 longevity steps. The difference between starting pay and top pay in any grade is about 30 percent. Workers who are never promoted can reach the top of their grade in less than 20 years. Few people outside government know about the virtually automatic longevity raises that go to thousands of workers with enough time-in- grade each year, in addition to any regular January pay raise. But Clinton administration pay reformers are keenly aware of the little-known longevity raises that add hundreds of thousands of dollars to agency payroll costs each year. Like earlier administrations, the White House is expected to attempt to make the raises less automatic and linked more to productivity and performance. By law, employees get the extra 3 percent longevity raise unless blocked by their boss every year in the first three steps of their civil service grade. Afterward, if they are still in the same grade, they get a longevity raise every two years. Finally, if they are still in the same grade, they get a longevity raise every three years in the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of their grade. Workers at the top -- the 10th step -- of their grade don't qualify for longevity increases. But like other employees, they still get the annual January increase.
Frenzied securities trading tied to the recent, robust stock market, as well as a surge in new-customer accounts, helped online broker ETrade Group Inc. post a narrower-than-expected loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31. And even though analysts expect ETrade to continue to lose money well into this year, shares of the Palo Alto, Calif., company leapt on the news In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, ETrade soared 20.875, or nearly 31, to 88.50, a new 52-week high. ETrade, which analysts say is trading like an Internet stock instead of a financial-services company, has seen its shares skyrocket 217 during the last three weeks. ETrade said it had a loss of 13.2 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, compared with profit of 5.1 million, or 12 cents a share, for last year's fiscal first quarter. The Wall Street consensus estimate was for a first-quarter loss of 30 cents a share. Core transaction revenues, mainly stock commissions, increased 60 from last year and 40 from the last, sequential quarter as investors clamored for hot Internet stocks and other technology issues. It's existing customers trading more . . . coupled with new customers coming online faster, ETrade Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said. But the flurry of trades couldn't make up for the 41 million ETrade poured into marketing to promote its new Web site, analysts said. ETrade, which is spending heavily to compete with scores of other low-priced Internet trading houses, could devote a staggering 50 million to 60 million to marketing this quarter, said Bill Burnham, who follows the company for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
After six years of industry consolidation, an array of production and sales problems continue to bedevil leading aerospace and defense companies. Two companies, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., are warning that their fourth-quarter earnings will drop below year-earlier levels. Boeing Co., which has struggled all year, is expected to do better in the quarter than it did in the year-earlier quarter but is warning of problems this year. Only Raytheon Co.'s prospects look brighter. Boeing and Northrop Grumman, whose fortunes are partially tied to the Seattle plane builder, have both warned of 1999 profit shortfalls of as much as 25 and 20, respectively, below Wall Street expectations, because of Boeing's miscalculation of the Asian economic crisis. The region's collapsing demand for jetliners -- especially the 747-led Boeing to announce sharp production cutbacks that will pressure margins in its commercial-jetliner division, which accounts for 60 of revenue. For the quarter, however, analysts estimate that Boeing earned about 42 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of 51 cents a share a year earlier, when the company struggled not with Asian fallout but with a costly production bottleneck at its Seattle-area assembly lines. Also in the year-earlier quarter, Boeing posted a one-time 1.4 billion pretax charge to phase out two jetliner models it inherited in its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp. Northrop Grumman, which derives about 12 of its revenue from building jetliner parts, most notably for the 747 jumbo jet, last week posted a 105 million charge stemming from increased costs to complete the fuselages because of Boeing's cutbacks. Additionally, Northrop Grumman, Los Angeles, posted a 20 million charge related to delays in a separate defense-electronics program. As a result, the company likely earned 90 cents a diluted share, compared with 1.71 a share in the year-earlier quarter, analysts say. Northrop Grumman's smaller charge, for the test delay, was typical of problems among the largest defense contractors. Although encouraged by the Pentagon amid stagnating procurement budgets, It would appear that the whole round of consolidation of all four companies, which has proceeded in quite a hurry, may be a factor in programs that go awry as the companies struggle to digest their acquisitions, said Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I.
Brazil rocked the world's markets, as news of a devaluation of its currency and the resignation of the country's centralbank president raised the specter of renewed financial-market turmoil in the region. Yesterday's surprise action widened the band within which the Brazilian currency, the real, trades. That sent the real down more than 8 against the dollar, and international investors fear there is considerable risk of further devaluation, which could hammer Latin American stocks and bonds again. Brazil's main stock-market index, the Bovespa, initially plummeted nearly 11, before ending the day down 5.1, or 299 points, at 5917, in moderate volume. But the steep opening drop dragged other Latin American markets sharply lower and delivered a blow to the European stock markets, many of which closed down more than 3. Argentina tumbled 10.2, Mexico dropped 4.6 and Venezuela dropped 3. Meanwhile in Europe, where the markets were still open when the devaluation and resignation news emerged, Spain dropped 6.9, Italy dropped 4.1, France 3.5, Germany 4.1 and London 3. Asian markets, which had already closed when Brazil made its announcements, were hit by their own domestic concerns as well as the slide in the U.S. market Tuesday. Further revelations about bad loans in China weighed on the Hong Kong market, which fell 4.1, while Singapore shed 2 and Thailand fell 3.6. The firmer dollar gave support to Japan's stock market, which rose 0.3.
I would like to respond to the letter from Ticked Off in Texas. His mother-in-law, Edna, used her granddaughter's name to get phone service, and then, Tiffany, the granddaughter, wound up 500 in debt. She filed charges against Grandma for fraud. You said, Relatives don't do that to one another. Ann, Tiffany had to file fraud charges to get the negative credit removed from her report. Paying it off without disputing the charges would still cause credit problems for the girl. I negotiate home loans for one of the nation's largest lenders. Here's what would have happened had Tiffany not filed the fraud report It would be virtually impossible for her to get a car loan at normal interest rates. She would forever have to put down a large deposit to get utilities. She would have difficulty qualifying for student loans, and certainly would have trouble getting her first home. Early credit problems for young people can forever change the way their credit is treated. Where I work, there is a flag put on credit reports for Social Security numbers issued in the last 18 years -- and thus belonging to minors. If the phone company had had this information, they would not have extended credit to Tiffany. While I'm at it, let me take this opportunity to get across some important credit information to your readers If you are moving to another state and plan to buy a home, keep close at hand your tax returns, bank statements and recent paycheck stubs. You will need these to qualify for the mortgage on a new home. If you are getting a divorce and dividing the debts, be certain you list the company name and account number for each credit card debt in the property settlement. Don't let your attorney write, He gets this bill, and she gets the other. Ten years later, it's difficult to determine who was supposed to pay what bills when new accounts and new spouses are added to the mix.
WASHINGTON -- President Clinton made a bold opening bid in the Social Security debate, proposing to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in the stock market and to create government-sponsored, 401k-type individual savings plans for taxpayers. We must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth, the president said during his State of the Union address last night. The plan, offered in the face of a congressional effort to remove the president from office, drew immediate and harsh criticism from congressional Republicans. But by agreeing to channel Social Security funds into the stock market and advocating individual savings accounts, the president advanced a debate that promises to be one of the most provocative of 1999. For Wall Street, the stakes are huge. The Clinton plan and some congressional alternatives would channel between 650 billion and 1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars into stocks over the next 15 years. At the end of that time, White House officials said, the government would own 4 of the entire U.S. market. A number of Republican alternatives would channel as much money into the stock market, but would do it through individual accounts. The amounts being talked about are large but not overwhelming. An investment of 650 billion over 15 years would equal about 3.6 billion in new money a month. By comparison, individual investors have put 1.1 trillion into the stock market since 1991 through mutual funds, or about 11.5 billion a month, according to the Investment Company Institute. Since 1996, those mutual-fund inflows have averaged 17.1 billion a month.
President Clinton's proposal to have a small percentage of Social Security money invested in the stock market could be just the tonic Wall Street needs to keep its bullish streak running into the 21st century. At least that's the conviction of market watchers, who note with glee how the invention of individual retirement accounts and 401k accounts have transformed the markets in the past two decades. Last year, almost 20 billion a month in new money flowed into the stock market from mutual funds. But some experts caution that such a huge shift could further pump up stock prices that some already consider inflated, while possibly hurting the bond market. Clinton is proposing diverting 62 percent of an anticipated 4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years to Social Security, then investing less than one-quarter of that amount in the equity markets instead of Treasury securities, in which the fund now invests. Clinton also wants to take another 11 percent of the budget surplus to establish universal savings accounts, which would be similar to the 401k accounts that many employers offer. Together, the two proposals could add as much as 6.5 billion or so a month to the market.
Fairfax County approved construction of more homes last year than at any time since the last recession, reflecting a robust economy that is expected to continue to grow in 1999 but at a slower pace. Residential building permits issued by the county rose 23 percent last year, to 8,342, from 6,774 in 1997, according to figures released this week. The level of activity was the highest since the mid-1980's, when a housing boom added 11,000 to 13,000 new homes a year. Last year was the best year since before the recession in total number of residential units, said Stephen S. Fuller, a George Mason University public policy professor who tracks the local economy. Everybody thought it couldn't go on like this after a strong 1997, but it did. Fairfax wasn't alone. Neighboring Arlington and Alexandria also reported an increase in both residential and commercial construction as Northern Virginia benefited from lower interest rates and a surge in new jobs. Some 41,000 jobs were added in the region, economists said, as mortgage interest rates dipped to a 30-year low. Economists keep a close eye on the number of residential and commercial building permits issued because it provides a leading indicator of the economy's health. Builders construct more new homes and offices if they sense growing demand and curtail activity if they see signs that it's weakening.
It is beyond trite to note that U.S. markets have absorbed Bill Clinton's impeachment without fear or agitation but would buckle if the guillotine blade were hurtling toward the neck of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. That analysis is also misleading It takes credit away from the truly heroic figure of the current history-defying U.S. economic expansion in a world of strong deflationary pressures. The hero to whom economists will build statues to commemorate this epoch is the American consumer. Yankee Consumer shoulders the burden of a world suddenly adrift economically by continuing to borrow, spend and consume with impressive single-mindedness. If that spending suddenly stops, the international financial game of musical chairs played in the Clinton years will come to a devastating halt. But there's also evidence that American consumers have instinctively understood that the world economy now operates on a new and still poorly glimpsed paradigm that pays little attention to classic rules of inflation, productivity or the relationship between currency values and interest rates. American buying habits are fueling unprecedented rises in U.S. private debt -- now estimated at 4 percent of gross domestic product -- and stock market valuations, which are feeding each other to produce a potential bubble economy. This should be the stuff of nightmares for Greenspan and Rubin.
President Clinton's surprise proposal to link the fate of Social Security more closely to the stock market began to stir doubts yesterday about how his initiative would affect the U.S. economy and prompted potent criticism from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. A day after Clinton made an overhaul of Social Security the centerpiece of his State of the Union address, his plan raised fundamental questions about whether the federal government should assume an unprecedented role in the workings of private enterprise. Greenspan, reflecting a wave of criticism that surfaced yesterday, contended that by pouring billions of dollars in Social Security reserves into Wall Street for the first time, the government inevitably would mingle politics into its investment decisions and would not produce the kind of returns that the administration hopes for. He also raised concerns about whether the government would end up in the business of picking which American companies are worth investing in. There is really no strong evidence to suggest any positive aspects of moving Social Security funds into equities, Greenspan, the chief architect of the government's last major revisions to Social Security 16 years ago, told members of the House Ways and Means Committee. Such skepticism arose as Clinton moved swiftly into full campaign mode to sell his Social Security plan to the public at a rally that attracted an overflow crowd in Buffalo.
The most arresting part of President Clinton's State of the Union message was his proposal to shore up the Social Security system. The president is correct in focusing on this challenge. In 1950 there were 16 taxpaying workers for every retired person in the U.S. Today there are just over three workers per retiree, and the ratio is expected to fall below two during the next century. If Social Security benefits are to be maintained under present arrangements, substantial tax increases will be required on workers and companies -- a burden that will discourage employment. Alternatively, other government receipts will be required or large government deficits will reappear. Small wonder that Mr. Clinton has searched for a magic bullet that might painlessly avoid the hard choices. There are two parts to the president's proposal. The first is to preserve the budget surplus and allocate a substantial proportion to the trust fund. The second is to shore up the system by investing 700 billion from the trust fund in the stock market over the next 15 years. Presumably by investing in stocks that historically have produced returns considerably above the yield on long-term Treasury bonds, the trust fund would grow more rapidly, and the date when the fund would run out of money would be pushed out much later in the century. Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest part of the trust fund in equities is the more radical part of his plan. It is a bad idea with unpredictable and probably damaging consequences. Moreover, simply investing a part of the trust fund in stocks will not provide the extra resources to spare us from making hard choices during the next century. Having the government invest in private securities runs against the principles of free markets and could well interfere with the efficiency of the capital-allocation process. While the government would undoubtedly propose that the funds be given to an independent or private agency that would invest in a very broad equity index of perhaps thousands of securities, such a plan would necessarily increase the allocation of capital to larger companies at the expense of very small entrepreneurial concerns that lack the liquidity to accommodate large government purchases. Many of these smaller start-up companies are responsible for important productivity improvements.
Playing the stock market can resemble blackjack-table guesswork. But move the market to a Web-based simulation -- giving yourself 100,000 in Monopoly money in the process -- and you might learn something. These simulations have become popular parts of personal finance and portal sites. Most of the real-world rules apply, and each transaction costs a commission of 15 or so. Top finishers can win prizes, converting their funny money to hard cash. Almost all games build in a 20-minute time delay from the market and reset players' accounts on the first of the month. I tried games at ETrade and Yahoo, starting with a shameful lack of knowledge in either trading or investing. In each I wound up with a little less money, but much wiser in the ways of the market. com was the geekier of the two, with a customizable main menu that automatically graphs major market indicators throughout the day. Its handy stockwatch feature lets you set upper and lower boundaries for a stock's price, then alerts you when it crosses either limit. But ETrade's inability to memorize my log-in was annoying, and its trial-by-fire approach doesn't help beginners. Yahoo's Investment Challenge httpquote.yahoo.com had trouble executing some trades and didn't let me peruse my trading history, making it harder to track how much I'd paid for what. But its news updates, customized for one's holdings, effectively teach how stocks move according to news throughout the day.
NEW YORK -- A lack of conviction kept a lot of traders sitting on the sidelines of the options market. With few reasons to take a stand on the direction of the broad market, or even individual stocks, traders wiled away the session reviewing earnings reports and watching the stock market swing like a pendulum between positive and negative territory. Options on some individual stocks traded strongly on specific news or strong hunches. Microsoft Corp.'s announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split, subject to shareholder approval, made it the most actively traded option at all four exchanges. International Business Machines Corp., whose board meets today, also may announce a stock split, analysts said. IBM was the second most actively traded option in the market.
TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus grew a greater-than-expected 14 in December, including a 23 expansion in the surplus with the U.S. that could worsen trade tensions between the two countries. Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose to 1.415 trillion yen 12.36 billion on a customs-cleared basis in December from 1.237 trillion yen a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. The December figures reversed a narrowing of 16 in the trade surplus in November, and set the country's surplus growing again for the 20th time in the past 21 months. For all of 1998, Japan's trade surplus expanded 40 to 13.985 trillion yen, while the surplus with the U.S. grew 33 to 6.697 trillion yen, the ministry said. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia shrank 36 last year to 3.977 trillion yen. In December, Japan's overall exports fell 12 to 4.130 trillion yen. But in a continuation of a pattern that has pushed Japan's surplus steadily higher since Asia's economic crisis hit, imports fell even faster, declining 22 to 2.715 trillion yen. On the import side, it was the steepest monthly drop in 12 years. Exports to the U.S. fell 6.1 to 1.175 trillion yen, while imports from the U.S. fell 25 to 578 billion yen, bringing Japan's surplus for the month to 597.26 billion yen. Japan's surplus could expand further if the country's weak economy continues to overwhelm the boost a strengthening yen usually gives to imports. A stronger yen tends to make imports more appealing because they cost less in yen terms. Still, in December, the drop in imports came despite an increase in the yen's value to an average of 119.91 per dollar in December from 128.18 yen per dollar the previous December.
WASHINGTON -- The top regulator of the stock market is concerned about the explosion in online trading, through which some of the frenzied buying and selling of Internet-related stocks is being done. Yesterday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt cautioned individual investors that rapid-fire online buying and selling can be hazardous to their savings accounts. Online investors should remember that it is just as easy, if not more, to lose money through the click of a button as it is to make it, Mr. Levitt said in a statement yesterday. The remarks follow rising complaints about online-trading services bogging down as investors jockey to trade increasingly volatile technology stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mr. Levitt said he is particularly alarmed by the rise in day trading, in which sometimes-inexperienced investors trade stocks continuously to reap quick, short-term profits.
America Online Inc. said it will buy MovieFone Inc. for about 388 million in stock, adding the seller of movie tickets to its stable of city-guide offerings. At 29.25 a share, the transaction values MovieFone at a premium of 4.25, or 17, to its Friday closing price. Shares of MovieFone fluctuated wildly yesterday after the company made a morning announcement that it was in talks for a sale. The stock rose as high as 33 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, then dipped back to close at 26.50 just before trading was halted for AOL's late-afternoon announcement. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of AOL fell 4.5625 to close at 171.1875. MovieFone, based in New York, is best known for its telephone-ordering service, which lets moviegoers call and buy tickets by punching in a credit-card number. The service -- with its signature introduction, Hello And welcome to MovieFone -- has become a pop-culture emblem parodied on Seinfeld and other television shows. But in recent months MovieFone has placed a growing emphasis on its MovieLink site on the World Wide Web, which lets Net surfers order movie tickets online. Moviegoers pay 1.50 a ticket for the service.
One of the great moments from the Starr Report is when Monica Lewinsky earnestly offers the American President her thoughts on education. But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs. Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment. And what a reward it is 1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7 of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal. Just for reference Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9 of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4 of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War 19 in 1952, Vietnam 19.7 in 1969 and the Cold War 19.7 of 1981. He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up. It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by 143 billion, or 9, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of 126.2 billion, or 8.7, from 1996 to 1997.
Stock prices declined today as investors, worried that higher interest rates could drag corporate earnings lower, took profits for the second day in a row. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.58 points, to 9274.12, extending Monday's 13-point decline. The Dow was down 147.53 at one point today before recovering. Broader stock indicators were lower as well, led by technology shares. The Nasdaq composite declined 46.67, to 2463.42. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.01, to 1261.99. Stock prices began falling early on Wall Street after Japan's interest rates rose to their highest levels since July 1997. The higher Japanese rates sent the dollar and U.S. bond prices lower in New York, as U.S. investors anticipated that their Japanese counterparts, important buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds, would begin routing some of their funds away from U.S. securities and into Japan.
Interest-rate jitters and profit-taking dragged stocks in Asia and Europe lower as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy committee meeting. While the Fed decided to leave U.S. short-term rates unchanged yesterday afternoon, the news came too late to revive wilting stocks in Asia and Europe. And investors still are waiting to see whether the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, both of which meet today, will lower European and British interest rates. German stocks fell 1.5, France fell 1.3, Italy shed 1, and Britain dropped 1.2. Meanwhile in Asia, the focus was on Japan, where government bond yields continued to climb. This boosted the yen, and hurt Japanese stocks, which fell 1.3. The key index in Hong Kong fell 0.9, South Korea dropped 2.5 and Thailand shed 2.6. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.32 point, or 0.16, to 205.77. In trading in Asia Thursday, Tokyo closed the morning session down 1.6, while South Korea was 1.4 lower in late-morning dealings. Hong Kong had shed 0.5 in early trading.
THE FED LEFT short-term rates unchanged, keeping the federal funds rate at 4.75, though the economic slowdown that the Fed expected has yet to materialize. The stock market closed higher after the widely expected report. The Dow Jones industrials rose 92.69 points to 9366.81, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.22. Treasurys ended modestly lower. Wall Street economists are rushing to revise their forecasts amid recent statistics that point to stronger, not weaker, growth in the months ahead. --- Goodyear will close a big U.S. tiremaking operation and cut 2,500 to 2,800 jobs world-wide as it expands its reach through its Sumitomo Rubber alliance.

The president's budget this week boasts of the Clinton commitment to biomedical research by generously funding the National Institutes of Health budget. It renews the commitment that the president made to vastly expanding biomedical research. This funding, the administration notes, has made the United States the world leader in medical research. If you buy that rhetoric then you can accept the president's definition of is -- as in there is no sexual affair -- or alone -- as in whether he was alone while having oral sex. The truth is the president has beaten an unconscionable retreat in his NIH budget. Last year, prodded by outside groups like Research America, a bipartisan group of legislators committed themselves to doubling the health-research budget over the next five years. The first installment was a 15 hike to 15.6 billion for the current fiscal year. In signing that legislation, the president praised it as a critical downpayment for his 21st-century research fund for America, and while he proposed a 50 hike over five years, he indicated support for doubling that budget. In the 2000 budget, however, he seeks only a 2 increase, not even enough to keep pace with inflation this would be the smallest increase in the NIH budget this decade. Health-research experts say this budget would stifle the NIH's momentum, lessen the prospects for major breakthroughs in the next decade, leave scores of promising grant proposals unfulfilled and discourage bright young scientists from entering the biomedical research field.
MONTREAL -- While Canada enjoys its healthiest economy in years, it faces a worrisome threat Lagging productivity growth is undercutting its ability to compete in the future. Last Friday, the government said Canada's unemployment rate fell to 7.8 in January from 8 in December, hitting its lowest level since June 1990. Employment in January rose 87,400, or 0.6, its biggest monthly rise since December 1987. The Canadian dollar finished the week at 67.08 U.S. cents, its strongest level since last July. But longer term, recent studies conclude, slowing productivity growth threatens to drag down Canada's living standard for decades to come. In different ways, the Canadian dollar's years-long slide, high taxes, skimpy research budgets and heavy regulation are all taking their toll. Signs of trouble are spreading. Here in Montreal, BioChem Pharma Inc. became a star of Canada's biotechnology sector by developing the widely used AIDS drug 3TC. But now, the company is moving aggressively to expand its vaccine business -- in Massachusetts. BioChem tried for two years to lure development specialists to Canada from the U.S., but attracted zero qualified people, says its chief executive officer, Francesco Bellini. We can compete on salary, but we can't compete on taxes, he says. Since 1990, manufacturing productivity has increased less than half as fast in Canada as in the U.S., the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reports. It is now only about 70 of the U.S. level. If Canada doesn't change its ways, its per capita gross domestic product will plunge from 10 above the OECD average now to 15 below that level in 20 years, the organization predicts. After taxes and inflation, Canada's per capita personal income has slid since 1990 and now trails that of Mississippi, according to the Bank of Montreal's Nesbitt Burns securities unit.
WASHINGTON -- U.S. banks aren't any longer tightening standards for lending to businesses, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of senior bank loan officers found. Only 7 of domestic banks told the Fed in January that they were raising the bar to midsize and large business borrowers in a survey conducted in November, 37 said they were. A mere 4 of the banks said they were tightening lending standards to small companies, compared with 15 in November. When the Fed cut interest rates last fall, it cited, among other things, banks' reluctance to make loans and investors' reluctance to buy risky corporate bonds. The new Fed survey suggests that credit conditions have improved lately, though they still aren't as easy as they were in the first half of 1998. Business demand for loans seems to have strengthened over the past three months, the new survey showed. The major factor, the bankers told the Fed, was that business customers have shifted borrowing from other sources that have become less attractive. However, the Fed noted that U.S. branches of foreign banks continue to show a reluctance to make business loans. More than 60 of the foreign banks surveyed said they had tightened standards for approving commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit.
The District reported a record 445 million budget surplus for 1998 yesterday, and Mayor Anthony A. Williams and other officials deemed it proof that the once nearly bankrupt city has made a speedy and powerful financial recovery. Williams D, who was the District's chief financial officer before running for mayor last year, said increased tax revenue from the strong economy and stock market, coupled with tight spending controls and more aggressive tax collection efforts, contributed to the surplus. The city located more than 15,000 new tax filers during 1998, mostly individuals who had not bothered to file returns in the past, officials said. The surplus wiped out the District's 332 million deficit from years of overspending, leaving the city with a positive balance of 112.5 million. Unlike other major cities that bounced back from severe financial crises by borrowing heavily, the District recovered by generating large back-to-back budget surpluses. This city, I believe, has gone farther and faster in a financial recovery . . . than any other American city similarly situated, Williams said. D.C. Council member Jack Evans D-Ward 2 said that the District's financial outlook is bright and that Williams and other city officials deserve credit.
Strong economic growth last year gave a healthy boost to labor productivity, allowing firms to give their workers solid pay increases while raising the prices of what they produced only slightly, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Gains in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- are a key ingredient in raising the nation's living standards. Consider this arithmetic Last year businesses other than farms increased their workers' compensation 4.2 percent while raising the prices they charged only 0.7 percent. The companies could do that without clobbering their profits because productivity gains offset 2.2 percentage points of that difference. And other cost-saving actions reduced non-labor costs by 1.4 percent on each unit of output. The overall result was a combination that's hard to beat. The firms eked out a small increase in profit on each unit sold, workers' real pay went up 2.6 percent faster than consumer prices, and inflation went down. The Labor Department uses the consumer price index, which rose 1.6 percent last year, to adjust compensation for inflation. However, many analysts and policymakers are questioning whether such good news is likely to continue for long.
Philips Electronics NV's two-year financial recovery ground to a halt as the company reported an 853 million guilder 437 million operating loss for the fourth quarter. The economic crisis in Asia and parts of Latin America, as well as a costly fiasco in the U.S. mobile phone market, took a big toll on Philips's results, reversing a 1.16 billion guilder operating profit in the yearearlier quarter. The loss partly reflects two billion guilders in charges and provisions taken to cover such problems. Reflecting the difficult market conditions, sales fell 6 to 19 billion guilders from 20.3 billion guilders. Net income, however, jumped to 10.32 billion guilders from 2.67 billion guilders, buoyed by onetime gains largely related to the sale of Philips's 75 stake in PolyGram NV to Canada's Seagram Co. Philips warned that it expects to report lower earnings during the first two quarters of this year, while a possible recovery would have to wait until the second half of the year. Philips will return to double-digit growth of earnings per share in 1999, Chief Executive Officer Cor Boonstra vowed at a news conference in Amsterdam. Analysts said Philips still has plenty of upside potential left. While its entry into the mobile phone market proved disastrous, the company has gained consumer electronics market share in Asia, bolstered its brand name in the U.S., expanded a highly succesful semiconductor business and bolstered its balance sheet by disposing of noncore businesses such as PolyGram.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended little changed despite soaring stock prices and a tepid response to a Treasury sale of new 30-year bonds. Elsewhere, the corporate debt market continued to see a spate of offerings. Issuers view borrowing conditions as favorable now and worry that interest rates could rise, pushing up the cost of tapping the market. In the Treasurys market late yesterday, the outstanding 30-year Treasury bond's price was unchanged at 98 732. Its yield stood at 5.361, also unchanged and around its highest for 1999 so far. Meanwhile, in when-issued trading, the newly sold 30-year Treasury was quoted at a yield of 5.298. Early in the day, Treasurys reacted little to evidence of healthy consumer demand and a robust labor market. Government data showed January retail sales up 0.2 and weekly claims for state unemployment-insurance benefits falling to their lowest level in a year and a half.
David G. Herro, director of international equities for Chicago- based Harris Associates and a childhood fan of the TV game show Let's Make a Deal, likes to compare three stock market choices that investors can make, each one worth about 20 billion. Behind door number one, he says, you have Amazon.com, which doesn't generate a profit and maybe never will. Behind door number two, you have every phone company, every cell phone, every fixed telephone line in Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the world. Behind door number three, you have the entire New Zealand stock market. For Herro, the choice is clear. Anything but door number one. If you take door number one, you're not buying as an owner. You're buying as a speculator, he says. Herro, who co-manages both the Oakmark International and the Oakmark International Small Cap funds, believes that investors can find better value in many of the world's battered international markets than they can in the richly valued markets in the United States and Europe. His biggest holdings are in Latin America Asia outside Japan and Britain. Rather than fleeing from emerging markets, Herro says he is looking to add to holdings in businesses that are good and able to withstand the shock of devaluations, deflation and recession. Unfortunately for Herro and his clients, the strategy has yet to pay off. Over the past year, an investor would have been far better off with Amazon.com, which rocketed up tenfold in 1998, than with Oakmark International, whose value dropped 7.01 percent in 1998 even after a strong recovery in the fourth quarter.
Ecuador's move to devalue its currency for the third time in less than a year will ease pressures on the nation's floundering economy -- though not by much, given the failure of the nation's Congress to pass badly needed tax measures. It was this failure last Thursday that precipitated the resignation of respected Finance Minister Fidel Jaramillo and the move by the Central Bank to allow the sucre to float on Friday morning. The president has his hands tied, said an analyst at Multiplica Cia., an economic consulting firm in Quito. Congress isn't helping him. The sucre dropped 3.6 on Friday to an interbank midrate of 7,580 sucres to the U.S. dollar from 7,305 sucres on Thursday. Since the end of 1997, when the sucre was at 4,430 to the dollar, it has lost more than 41 of its value. The Central Bank couldn't hold out after losing nearly 300 million of its reserves over the past month as local investors rushed to swap sucres for dollars. Ecuador's economic activity also was being choked by short-term interest rates in the triple digits. The Central Bank sharply boosted the overnight interbank lending rate in January in an attempt to slow the flight of dollars after Brazil floated its currency. Friday the Central Bank lowered the rate to 95 from 140.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks fell sharply, posting steeper losses than the rest of the stock market. The Nasdaq Composite Index posted the sharpest decline of the major stock market averages. Since last setting an all-time high on Feb. 1, it has fallen 10.4. The Nasdaq composite, at 2248.91, plunged 64.96, or 2.81, yesterday. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has dropped 8.8 since the end of January, and stands 20.7 below its April 21 record close. The index fell 6.86, or 1.73, to 389.54 yesterday. As has been the case since the current small-cap and Nasdaq pullback began, the groups' losses were fueled by the weakness of the technology sector. Stocks in a wide range of tech-sector industry niches fell substantially. Meanwhile, the mania for hot new technology stocks continues.
FRANKFURT -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG must reach concrete results this spring in efforts to restructure its ailing Rover unit, BMW's new chairman, Joachim Milberg, said. BMW's turnaround team already recommended to the board measures to integrate and improve Rover's business, Mr. Milberg said in an interview with Die BMW Zeitung, an internal BMW publication. Steps are being taken to bring Rover to the necessary efficiency and productivity level, he said. As said before, all these steps can't be discussed furtherthey need urgently to be implemented. Mr. Milberg said investment and workflexibility programs under way at Rover are just the start of a row of measures, adding that BMW will do everything to deliver the Rover 75 model at a BMW-quality level. Speculation surfaced last week that details of additional restructuring at Rover, of Britain, would come at the group's annual shareholders' meeting May 18. BMW's supervisory board is set to meet March 18. Less than two weeks ago, Mr. Milberg succeeded as chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder, who stepped down from the post amid sharp criticism of problems and financial losses at Rover. Mr. Milberg previously was BMW's board member in charge of engineering and production.
From a working mother cleaning hotel rooms for a little more than the minimum wage to a computer-company executive bringing home almost half a million dollars a year, Americans across the economic spectrum will pay less of their income in federal taxes this year than they did 20 years ago. You read that right. It may be hard to believe when every street corner seems to have a politician claiming you're overtaxed and need a tax cut. But an analysis by the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm for The Washington Post shows that Reagan-era cuts for higher-income taxpayers, Clinton-era help for the working poor and targeted tax cuts contained in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement have all helped keep federal taxes for most Americans lower than they were in 1979. To the extent that the economy has made everybody better off, they're better off and they're not paying as much tax as they would have under the old rules, said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche. This analysis might help explain why some of the oomph has gone out of the impact of tax-cut promises. Robert J. Dole's pledge to cut taxes across the board did little for his losing 1996 campaign against President Clinton. And recent polling indicates that Republican calls for another tax cut don't seem to excite many Americans. Most seem to prefer improving education or overhauling Social Security. Republicans argue that a tax cut is necessary because, by their analysis, when federal taxes are measured against the size of the overall economy, the federal tax burden is as high as it has been in more than half a century. Federal tax revenue is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to hit 20.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product this year GDP is a common measure of the size of the economy. That would mark the second-highest level recorded since the dawn of the modern income tax in 1913. Tax revenue hit its highest level ever-- 20.9 percent of GDP--in 1944, when the federal government was extracting enormous amounts of tax revenue to finance World War II.
WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices increased a scant 0.1 last month, as prices for certain consumer goods -- notably clothing -- continued to fall. January's meager inflation rate was the same as December's, and over the past year consumer prices have climbed just 1.7, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding food and energy prices, considered to be volatile sectors, consumer prices rose a similar 0.1 in January, following a 0.3 increase in December. To better understand just how well-behaved inflation is, it helps to look at particular sectors. For example, while prices overall crept up, apparel prices plunged in January by 1.1, after a 0.6 drop in December. Over the past year, clothing prices fell 1.4 compared to a 0.4 increase the previous year. Women's apparel fell 1.9 last month compared to a 0.6 drop in December, while footwear dropped 0.9 following a 0.6 decline. Energy prices, which fell 0.2 in January, helped to keep the overall transportation figure down, despite a 0.1 rise in gasoline prices. Tobacco prices jumped 6.6 after a 18.5 spike in December, and air fares rose 1.8, following recent announcements by major airlines of across-the-board fare increases.
WASHINGTON -- Economic forecasters surveyed quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia no longer expect as much of a slowdown in the U.S. economy during the first half of the year. The average of the 33 private forecasts put growth in the first two quarters of 1999 at an annual 2.85 pace, well above the 1.7 they predicted just three months ago. The economy expanded at a 3.9 rate in 1998. Despite the economy's stronger-than-expected growth, the forecasters are more optimistic about inflation than they were in previous surveys. They expect consumer prices to rise only 2 in 1999, marking down their forecasts to reflect changes in the government's consumer price index. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect the CPI to climb 2.3 a year. With continued growth and little uptick in inflation, the forecasters expect the stock market to keep climbing over the next decade, but they foresee returns closer to the historical norm. On average, they expect the total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 index to be 8 a year after inflation, down from the 9 they forecast last year. The inflation-adjusted return on the S&P 500 last year exceeded 20. The Philadelphia Fed doesn't probe for the forecasters' short-term outlook for the stock market. Over the next decade, the forecasters are predicting that the U.S. economy will expand at about 2.5 a year, after adjusting for inflation, and that productivity, or output per hour of work, will climb 1.55, up slightly from 1.5 in last quarter's survey.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed is ready to move quickly -- but doesn't know if it will be to raise interest rates or to lower them. Mr. Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking Committee confirmed the widespread perception that the Fed is in wait-and-worry mode, as Salomon Smith Barney economists put it, and isn't planning any change in rates soon. Although the stock market showed a mixed reaction to the Fed chief's testimony, bond prices sank. Analysts pointed to Mr. Greenspan's comment that the Fed is evaluating whether the third of last year's three quarter-percentage-point interest rate cuts remains appropriate. But most of Mr. Greenspan's testimony was a catalog of the considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook and an attempt to explain why inflation remains so docile. The upside risk is that the economy's strength will outstrip its capacity to produce, and inflation will finally emerge. After eight years of economic expansion, Mr. Greenspan said, the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions. Employers can't keep hiring as they have been, because the hiring pool is shrinking. But the downside risks are also substantial. Stock prices, which have sustained consumer and business spending, are high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued, Mr. Greenspan said. And weakening economies overseas, not just in emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, could further depress demands for our exports, the Fed chairman added.
Senate legislation setting a 4.8 percent military raise for next January is almost certain to include language urging the same raise for 1.2 million white-collar federal workers. Although it is tough to compare federal civilian and military pay because of various allowances accorded military personnel, both groups work for the same employer and generally get raises at the same time each year. But they don't always receive the same percentage amounts. Raises for civilian and military personnel are based on different political, economic and strategic considerations. That means one group is often playing pay catch-up with the other. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John W. Warner R-Va. has military pay on a legislative fast track. The bill would move separately from -- and ahead of -- the much larger defense authorization bill. But Warner, with strong bipartisan support, wants the pay raise issue dealt with fast and first. He has agreed to include language promising pay-raise equity from a non-binding resolution by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes D-Md..
The 1,000 companies on the Shareholder Scoreboard are major players in their industries and should be of significant interest to investors. With a total market capitalization of 11.384 trillion, they represent more than 90 of the market value of all publicly traded U.S. stocks as measured by the Wilshire 5000. The Scoreboard companies were selected by L.E.K. Consulting using a careful screening process. It began with the 725 U.S. stocks included at the end of 1998 in the Dow Jones Global Indexes, a family of world-wide stock-market indexes calculated by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. L.E.K. eliminated six stocks that hadn't traded for at least a year, producing a list of 719 companies across 94 industries. Next, L.E.K. added another 281 corporations, based on market capitalization, that weren't included in the Dow Jones Global Indexes. Again, these companies had to have traded for at least a year mutual funds were excluded. Since the Scoreboard is meant to track stocks incorporated and trading in the U.S., American depositary receipts and foreign stocks -- including shares of companies such as DaimlerChrysler AG that are incorporated abroad but trade in both U.S. and overseas markets -- were generally excluded. But companies were included if, like Carnival Corp., they are incorporated elsewhere but trade primarily or exclusively on U.S. exchanges. The additional 281 companies were selected by relying on data from Dow Jones and Media General Financial Services Inc., a unit of Media General Inc., Richmond, Va.
American Greetings Corp. unveiled a productivity initiative that the company said will exact a heavy toll on near-term revenue and earnings. The news sent shares of the nation's second-largest greeting-card concern down 32. In heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Greetings plunged 11.1875 to 23.875 after falling earlier to a new 52-week low of 23.25. The strategy, the company said, is aimed at fattening future profits by allowing American Greetings to equal or better existing retail sales with less inventory. The plan is designed to let the company better exploit recent investments in technology that have shortened the time required to design, produce and ship a new generation of cards. Consumers' tastes in greeting cards are changing faster than they have in the past, an American Greetings spokesman said. But the first phase of the company's plan, which calls for a sell-through that will reduce permanently the number of American Greetings cards on retailer's shelves, will slice about 100 million from revenue for the fiscal year beginning Monday. In essence, American Greetings will for a time replenish its existing cards on retailers' shelves at a rate lower than full replacement. Once that temporary process has lowered the retail-card inventory to the company's reduced target level, officials expect sales will continue at their current pace, or even strengthen.
Most people think factories should run with machine-like precision, but not Charlene Pedrolie. After becoming manufacturing chief at Rowe Furniture of Salem, Va., she tore apart the assembly line and sent gluers, staplers and seamstresses madly scurrying to build sofas as they saw fit. Amid the pandemonium of the shop floor, productivity and quality shot through the roof. Major corporations jealously track every dollar and proscribe the actions of every employee, right Wrong, in the case of the family-owned Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan. Operating mainly in energy and agriculture -- industries performing poorly almost everywhere else -- Koch has grown bigger than Microsoft, Coke or McDonald's in sales, with no budgets, no central planning and no fixed job descriptions. Economic pundits say small-time middlemen are toast in a high-tech economy. But they haven't met Jerry the Seal Man Whitlock, who buys and sells more than 1 million a year of seals and gaskets world-wide, mostly over the Internet from a spare bedroom in his house. Business is at war with family life, people say. But not at a chain of used-book outlets called Half Price Books. It has become the largest used-book dealer in the U.S. by expanding into cities where employees and family members have a personal reason to move. For the last four years I've been investigating such rule-breaking success stories in The Front Lines column for this page. But as the case studies piled up -- my travels took me to more than 100 cities in 30 states to industries as far-flung as semiconductor design and grease recycling -- the unusual seemed more and more like the norm. Everywhere I turned, it seemed, people were succeeding in business by doing the exact opposite of what business had long counted as conventional. Was it possible that these offbeat leaders were becoming the new order of business Was I witnessing a new ethos or simply some new fads A new dawn or some new Dilbert fodder The arrival of a new day or simply the ascendancy of a new generation These questions forced me to consider business on an unfamiliar new level. What were the most fundamental forces guiding business
The name is the game on Wall Street these days. A growing number of small public companies are finding that adding .com to their name can send their stock soaring. For investors, however, these volatile highfliers pose some particular risks. Many have little or no current operations and don't file financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And often, the trading pop soon at least partly fizzles. Take MIS International. Until January, this largely dormant little outfit traded on Nasdaq's OTC Bulletin Board for stocks that don't qualify for Nasdaq itself with daily volume as low as 2,000 shares and a price generally well south of 50 cents a share. The company then acquired a new Internet-oriented business plan and a new name, Cosmoz.com. Presto Trading volume rocketed to as much as six million shares a day and the price briefly hit 5, giving Cosmoz.com a market value of 200 million. Its price has since dropped back to about 2. Not too shabby for a company that hasn't yet turned a profit, and whose only operating business so far is a recently purchased financial-markets-information Web site that generates about 200,000 a year in revenue. However, Cosmoz.com does have a hip and catchy name that definitely contributed to the recent stock-market interest, says Wilfred Shaw, chairman and chief executive. He adds that Cosmoz.com has plans to acquire many Internet companies.
Fasten your seat belts. BE Aerospace Inc. could be preparing for takeoff again. The executives who are piloting the manufacturer of aircraft-cabin equipment started buying shares of company stock in February. This is the first significant round of activity since the summer of 1997, when BE Aerospace executives sold shares and reduced their stake in the company. There hasn't been much activity over the past year and a half, and because they were such heavy sellers in 1997, I find the buys very interesting, said Nancy Fedorowicz, an analyst at First Call Investnet, a Rockville, Md., concern that tracks insider transactions. The insiders have rekindled their interest in the stock just when shares were closing in on a 52-week low. From Feb. 10 to Feb. 19, six BE Aerospace insiders purchased 46,000 shares at 12.69 to 14.94, according to First Call Investnet. Yesterday, BE Aerospace shares closed at 14, down 43.75 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The latest round of purchases included top company officials, adding more credibility to the buys, some analysts said. The executives have been with the company for a while, they have a good track record and the cluster of activity represents fairly large dollar amounts, said Jonathan Moreland, director of research at InsiderTrader.com, a Web-based distributor of insider data. Just about every rule to get you interested in insider trading at a company is being ticked off.
President Clinton sent a letter to Phil Gramm R-Tex., chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, warning he will veto Gramm's proposed legislation to revamp banking laws if that legislation passes Congress in its present form. Clinton said Gramm's proposal fails to provide adequate consumer protections and gives the Federal Reserve too much regulatory authority over banks. The veto threat comes as the Senate and House banking committees draft final versions of financial service modernization bills that they hope to send for full floor votes by early summer. Boeing 737s must be inspected for a fire hazard in the center fuel tank, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA wants operators of the twin-engine aircraft -- the most common passenger aircraft in the world, with 2,984 in the worldwide fleet, including 1,181 registered in the United States -- to check the wiring of a fuel tank switch that prevents over-filling. The cost of disabling the switch and installing a caution sign is estimated at 180 per aircraft, or 212,580 for the domestic fleet for inspecting and reinstalling or replacing it the estimate is 1,080 per aircraft, or 1.3 million for the U.S. fleet. Occidental Petroleum said the Oklahoma Supreme Court has upheld a 742.2 million judgment against Chevron. The court affirmed a 1996 judgment favoring Occidental in a breach of contract case related to Chevron's purchase of Gulf Oil in 1984. Interest on the award has brought the total value of the award to 935 million, Occidental said. GE Aircraft Engines said it has laid off 270 workers in Massachusetts and Ohio to cut costs in the face of intense price pressures in the aircraft engine industry. The layoffs represent a small percentage of a 34,000-person work force. Allstate agreed to form a joint venture with Putnam Investments to sell a type of stock-linked retirement saving plan that has become a popular form of life insurance. The companies will sell variable annuities, a hybrid of mutual funds and insurance policies that let people make tax-deferred investments in the stock market.
NEW YORK -- With the U.S. economy continuing to surge ahead, the dollar won't be far behind. It is only how fast it can travel this week that is in question. Few disagree the dollar is headed higher against the yen and euro, guided by the U.S. economy's strength relative to Europe and Japan. In fact, last Friday's higher-than-expected employment data took a lot of uncertainty out of the market over the need for a tightening of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The figures again underlined the U.S. economy can grow at a strong pace without inflation. While lower U.S. rates usually mean a weaker dollar as the yield on dollar-denominated deposits declines, capital flows into the U.S. currency are increasing in line with gains in the U.S. stock market, said Joe Yuska, foreign-exchange manager at Banc One International in Dallas. There is nothing in the horizon that will trip up the dollar, said Mr. Yuska, who expects the euro could pass last week's low of 1.0785 to test 1.0680.
President Carlos Menem of Argentina recently proposed that his country give serious consideration to full dollarization -- the abandonment of its own currency, the peso, whose value is already fixed to the U.S. dollar. It's a good idea, not just for Argentina but for other countries in the Western Hemisphere. But the dollarization of the Americas won't happen without U.S. leadership. Argentina's disciplined monetary policy stands in stark contrast with that of some of its neighbors. At the beginning of the 1990s, Argentina enacted an array of economic reforms, including a currency-board type of monetary system. This regime ensured a fixed exchange rate -- one peso to the dollar -- and thereby promoted stability in prices and interest rates. Other Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, instituted some economic reforms but failed to make basic changes in monetary institutions. These countries adopted the worst-of-all-worlds system in which exchange rates neither float nor are genuinely fixed. Hence, they have suffered from volatility in exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. On some occasions, such as the Mexican debt crisis and devaluation of 1994-95 and the ongoing Brazilian fiscal crisis and devaluation, the financial markets have speculated that Argentina would deviate from its peg to the dollar. Argentina has withstood these pressures in the past, notably in 1995. But today's Brazilian situation is especially serious because Brazil is Argentina's largest trading partner. Argentina feels pressure to respond to Brazil's devaluation with a devaluation of its own. Anticipation of a devaluation raises interest rates, because of increases in currency risk and in related default risk. Consequently, the economy tends to contract. It was to counter this speculation and to reaffirm the commitment to a fixed exchange rate that Mr. Menem floated the idea of full dollarization. Since much of Argentina's financial system already operates in terms of the dollar, the main change would be a switch of the hand-to-hand currency from pesos to dollars. Then, as in Panama, it would be virtually impossible for the government to devalue -- in effect, there would be no peso assets whose value could be reset in terms of the dollar. Thus the financial markets would have no currency risk on which to speculate. In Argentina, the currency board has become highly popular, and a further move toward dollarization might also be popular. Nevertheless, a proposal to dollarize involves political peril. For one thing, Argentina's presidential election this fall makes it difficult for the opposing political parties to agree on a major change in the monetary regime. Domingo Cavallo, the principal architect of the Argentine economic miracle, opposes a move soon toward dollarization.
Corrections & Amplifications O'SULLIVAN INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS Inc. said it expects earnings for the fiscal third quarter ending March 31 will be up more than 70 from a year earlier. Yesterday's Small Stock Focus incorrectly stated that the company expects earnings to be up 24. WSJ Mar. 10, 1999 NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks rose moderately, outpacing most broad-market and blue-chip measures. A notable exception, however, was the overall Nasdaq market, which was sharply higher and posted the steepest gains of the major stock-market indexes. The overall Nasdaq market outperformed the small-cap market, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, largely because of the strength of Nasdaq's large-cap technology components.
A new legislative study says Florida's economic competitiveness with other states remains reasonably strong overall, but could be threatened in a few vital areas by low productivity and profitability. The in-depth report by the Legislature's Office of Economic and Demographic Research examined business data from Florida and 24 rival states. In part, the report simply confirms what previous research has showed Florida generally enjoys lower costs -- particularly labor costs -- than most of its rival states. For many sectors, that helps translate into strong competitiveness. For example, Florida's electronics-manufacturing sector is highly profitable, thanks in large part to low labor costs, the report notes. But with Florida's relatively low-skill, low-wage work force, productivity tends to be low, the report concludes. That is contributing substantially to relatively weak profitability in some industries. Even Florida's mighty hotel industry suffers from profitability that's 1.5 below the national average, the report shows. Of particular concern is the state's surprisingly low profitability in a couple of high-tech sectors that state leaders are anxious to nurture, including the aerospace industry. Profitability of that sector ranked 21st, and 10.1 below the average.
Internet wunderkinds aren't the only ones rushing to cash in on the rejuvenated IPO market. Buyout kingpins are lining up, too. But rather than launching initial public stock offerings of the latest Web-site fad, the buyout pros are bringing out IPOs in less-trendy companies -- the ones they bought as investments and now want to cash out of. Last week, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took public Boyds Collection, a maker of collectible kitsch, in an offering that valued his firm's investment at four times what it paid a year ago. Bully for Mr. Kravis. But are the buyouts-turned-IPOs good for today's IPO-hungry investors There's a mixed record there. What's certain is that buyout firms like KKR, which were sidelined from doing IPOs by the market's turmoil late last year, are lining up at the reopened IPO window, suggesting that public-market pricing is rich. Texas Pacific Group took public Del Monte Foods last month, six months after shelving the offering because of unfavorable markets. It recently filed to bring public Ducati Motor Holding, a venerable Italian motorcycle maker, on stock exchanges in Milan and New York.
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., plagued by lawsuits and uncertainty in the tobacco business, said yesterday that it will sever its cigarette unit from its Nabisco cookie and cracker operations, marking the end of a tumultuous corporate marriage. The move, long urged by a group of dissident shareholders, underscores how the legal and political battles that engulfed tobacco in the past decade have left one of the United States' earliest industries with few fans on Wall Street. Despite the booming stock market, the company's stock has lost more than half its value since 1991. Now, in hopes that investors will refocus on its core food products -- which include such brand names as Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers -- the company that produces Camel, Salem and Winston said it will spin off its domestic tobacco business to current shareholders and sell its international cigarette holdings to a Japanese firm for about 8 billion. The news did not immediately improve investors' opinion of the company's value. RJR Nabisco's stock initially jumped 5 percent on the news but drifted down during the day, closing up only 12 12 cents at 28.75. Reynolds served up something and investors kind of yawned at it, said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The company said the complex deal will not shield it from outstanding liabilities in the tobacco business.
DuPont, the biggest U.S. chemical company, said it expects to announce a pharmaceutical alliance this year and plans to issue stock to track the performance of its life-sciences businesses. DuPont, still a relatively small player in drugs, said it's in discussions with unspecified companies to help bulk up its pharmaceuticals business and help the company reach critical mass in the industry. The creation of two classes of common shares will allow investors to separate DuPont's life sciences, which are considered to be growing faster than its traditional chemical business. Journalists should shun the role of Chicken Little in reporting year 2000 computer problems and avoid undermining Americans' confidence in the banking system, a senior regulator said. If glitches occur or problems loom, report fully on them, of course, but make sure to place the problem in an appropriate context, Federal Reserve Board member Edward W. Kelley Jr. said during a panel discussion at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. Balance and perspective are key. Kelley said the Federal Reserve was conducting extensive advance planning to ensure that banks and savings institutions have cash on hand to meet any surge in demand late in the year from Americans nervous about losing access to their money if computers misread the year 00. The Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would restore network TV signals to about 750,000 satellite-dish customers who lost the signals two weeks ago because of a court order. The measure, introduced by Sen. John McCain R-Ariz., would place a moratorium on cuts until the end of the year, aiding more than 2 million dish owners who have lost signals or are scheduled to lose them. The broadcast industry opposes the bill. General Motors agreed to buy more than 1 billion in recycled aluminum over 13 years from Imco Recycling, to lock in supplies for lighter cars that meet new pollution standards. Imco, based in Irving, Tex., the world's largest recycler of aluminum and zinc, will build a 22 million plant in Zilwaukee, Mich., as part of the deal. As automakers strive to use more aluminum in place of steel, still the dominant metal in the industry, they are seeking supply and price guarantees. The Today Sponge, the most popular over-the-counter contraceptive for women before it was pulled off the market in 1995, is headed back to U.S. drugstores. A newly founded New Jersey company, Allendale Pharmaceuticals, said it has bought the sponge from its previous manufacturer and hopes to begin selling it again by fall. The Food and Drug Administration said there was never any problem with the product's safety. Instead, then-manufacturer Whitehall- Robins Healthcare decided it would cost too much to upgrade the old manufacturing plant where it made the sponge to meet stringent government safety rules.
NEW YORK -- The hairy beast of inflation, hunted to the brink of extinction in the broader economy, has taken refuge in the Ivory Tower. Even while prices on everything from clothing to computer chips steadily decline, the cost of getting an education continues to rise, whether the sought-after institution is a private Ivy League college, a public university or a popular preschool. In recent weeks, private universities have been announcing tuition for the 1999-2000 academic year, and the increases -- which range between 3 and 5 -- are more than double the annual rate of inflation. Private grade schools and preschools are boosting tuition as much as 7. Public universities, which depend on state legislation to determine tuition, won't release new fees until the summer. However, previous increases have tended to be slightly lower than private-school increases, but still above inflation. To hear some schools tell it, students should be happy that the increases aren't higher. The actual cost of a Harvard education is close to 48,000 per year, lamented Harvard University when it announced a few weeks ago that next fall's fees will rise 3.3 to 32,164. Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., which plans to charge 30,939 for tuition and room and board next fall, seems disappointed that its tuition remains significantly behind our major competition-Harvard, Yale and Princeton. The 3.5 increase will not close the gap. How can educational institutions justify raising tuition at a time when inflation has nearly disappeared and when the stock market's stunning performance has boosted college endowments about 74, on average, in the past four years
Oil prices are beginning to recover from low levels that produced inflation relief and record-low pump prices, and so are oil industry stock prices, which contributed to the run-up in the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday. The rally, which has pushed crude oil prices up 33 percent from a 12-year low of 10.72 in December, resulted from different developments, according to oil industry experts. The prospect of further cuts in production when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies meets on March 23, a reduction in inventories and heavy demand for heating oil in Germany in advance of an increase in tariffs have all fed the trend. Yesterday the rally stalled and prices fell slightly, with April crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropping 38 cents to 14.31 a barrel. But many analysts continue to believe that the signs point to a production cutback by OPEC nations, which were meeting in preliminary sessions yesterday and today in Amsterdam. In the past, many oil-producing nations doubted Saudi Arabia's commitment to reducing production, several analysts said. But meetings over the past 10 days between Saudi Arabia and Iran have begun to remove those doubts, said Roger Diwan, director of global oil markets for the D.C.-based Petroleum Finance Corp. But industry analyst Constantine Fliakos of Merrill Lynch & Co. said that Venezuela, which also is a member of OPEC, is under pressure from its unions to maintain production at current levels, which might threaten an agreement.
Further evidence that inflation is dormant emerged yesterday as the government reported a 0.4 percent drop in the producer price index last month, the biggest decline in more than a year. The report cheered financial markets, but an early rally in the stock market petered out after the Dow Jones industrial average came within 42 points of breaching the 10,000 level. The average finished the day at 9876.35, down 21.09 points, after several big companies issued disappointing earnings forecasts. Bonds rose, with the 30-year Treasury bond gaining 5.53 per 1,000 invested, and its yield falling 0.04 percent to 5.52 percent. The fall in the PPI, which measures the prices of finished goods produced at factories, farms and refineries, was mostly from decreases in the volatile food and energy categories. The food index dropped 1.4 percent, because of falling prices for meat and vegetables, and the energy index fell 1 percent mainly because of a steep decline in heating oil prices. But even the core index, which excludes food and energy, was flat in February, underscoring the remarkable absence of inflationary pressures in the robust U.S. economy.
BOSTON -- State Street Corp. Chief Executive Marshall Carter, whose bank's stock-market performance has beaten many of its peers, received a special long-term incentive payment of 5.7 million last year. The bank's executives are eligible to receive the special payments every two years if the company meets certain goals of profitability and stock-market performance, according to the company's latest proxy statement. Mr. Carter's award was more than triple the amount he received in 1996, the last year he was eligible. The four other top executives received similar awards ranging from 1.7 million to 3.5 million. Mr. Carter also received an award of restricted stock that the company valued at 1.2 million. Meanwhile, his base salary increased 4, to 976,265. His bonus fell to 895,372, from 1.4 million in 1997. In all, Mr. Carter received total pay of more than 8.7 million last year, compared with 2.3 million in 1997. Mr. Carter also realized 6 million by exercising 148,980 in stock options last year.
NEW YORK -- Merger news animated banking and technology, and optimism about earnings fired up transports, sending market averages to new highs, though not to widely anticipated milestones. Banking names such as J.P. Morgan, which improved 3 38 to 125 38, Bank One, which rose 2 18 to 57 116, and Mellon Bank, which gained 2 916 to 73 12, all moved higher after Fleet Financial and BankBoston announced plans for a 16 billion combination. Meanwhile, technology stocks improved on merger hopes, as well. CMGI shot up 28 58 to 192 58 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after reports over the weekend in the Boston Globe indicated the Internet marketing and investment concern expects to lure other bids for Lycos, the Internet concern it holds a piece of. Lycos climbed 7 18 to 105 34 on Nasdaq, while a host of other Internet names advanced. The strength of CMGI helped the whole group, said Tim Grazioso, Nasdaq-trading manager at Cantor Fitzgerald. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 82.42, or 0.83, to finish at 9958.77, its highest close ever, and first above 9900.
Personal-computer makers seem destined for a disappointing first quarter, but evidence of a lasting drop in demand remains inconclusive. Jitters about PC sales contributed to a sharp drop in many technology shares yesterday. The sell-off was partly triggered by comments from market researcher PC Data Inc., which on Monday said U.S. retail unit sales of PCs in February rose just 1, while revenues dropped 16. Later the same day, PC maker Micron Electronics Inc. reported a 24 drop in sales for the fiscal second quarter ended March 4. Some of the revenue slowdown reflects rapid declines in PC prices. Some customers also appear to have held up purchases until they could buy machines based on a new chip from Intel Corp. A more subtle factor, analysts and industry executives say, is that many investors appeared to be betting that computer spending associated with the year 2000 problem might stimulate PC purchases in the quarter. That now doesn't appear to have happened. It's clear that the first calendar quarter has not been as strong as everyone expected it to be, said Joel Kocher, Micron Electronics' chief executive officer. I would characterize it as squishy.
The children's defenses lowered, and a sense of camaraderie and adventure rose to take their place at a campsite in rural Maryland. At once, 37 boys and girls were just a short ride from their fractured District neighborhoods -- and fully a world away. Two boys wandered off from a blazing campfire and ran to a bench in the shadow of an old barn. They lay down on their backs and looked up into the black sky, taking in all the stars that are so hard to see from home. I've never been to a place like this before, Toribio Contreras, 13, told his friend Clayton Chatman, 12. Why can't it always be this good Toribio and Clayton, who both live in the Shaw neighborhood of Northwest Washington, met 35 other children from some of the District's most impoverished neighborhoods Saturday night to do something so removed from their everyday experiences that for some, it required an explanation. They went camping. Is there going to be a test asked Isaac McLaughlin, 10, as he found a seat on a school bus that picked up 12 children from an Anacostia apartment building. Are we going to the Virginia That must be five hours away. What if we fail the test
Your article on Chile-Japan trade, Chilean Firms Suffer Pain From Japanese Recession, is engaging and encouraging, yet its focus on short-term setbacks may stand a different reading if viewed from a global, longer-term perspective. To Chile, trading with Japan is part of a broader Asia positioning effort whose scope reaches beyond short-term issues. The two nations have a century-old record of cooperation and trade. Distance has been no object to doing business. Japan, now the second most important destination for global Chilean exports, has ranked as one of our four largest trading partners ever since 1970. About 13 of all Chilean goods currently sold abroad are bought by Japan. The success of Chile-Japan trade links warrants further analysis. Our partnership is far from having peaked, and Japan is far from a market lacking in possibilities. True, the dollar value of sales to Japan fell 28 in 1998, but a whopping 82 of this U.S. 593 million was simply due to lower ore and copper prices. A softer market for just five items -- mineral ores, copper cathodes, dressed pine boards, gold, and fish in brine -- accounted for 100 of the dollar drop in sales to Japan. Such is the predicament of commodity sellers today, a predicament that is hard on us all, not just Japan. Still, the record for 1998 shows an 81 increase in the diversity of products exported to Japan over 1997, as well as 27 firms newly joining the ranks of bilateral trade. In other words, despite Japan's downturn, trade with Chile, save for a few, admittedly major items, continues to thrive. Hector Casanueva Director, ProChile
With the Dow Jones industrials on the brink of 10,000, you might think this would be a period of celebration and congratulation. But no. The gloomy financial pundit class is issuing more ultimatums than NATO and heaping scorn on those poor saps who have sextupled their money in America Online Inc. The truth is, small investors have been right for the past five years. When stocks fell sharply in October 1997 and again during the summer of 1998, many pros panicked, but the little guys held their ground. Still, the theme emerging in the press on the eve of quintuple digits is that dimwitted investors have forgotten the past. After several years in which stocks do better than their long-term average- -as they have in the 1990s--there is a better-than-even chance that they'll underperform over the subsequent several years, wrote Mark Hulbert last week in the New York Times. Hulbert quoted two economics professors, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale, as saying that stocks will drop by one- third--or worse. But don't panic just yet. Campbell and Shiller have been bearish for a long time. It was Shiller who issued the influential dire warning at a Federal Reserve Board meeting in 1996 just before Chairman Alan Greenspan's irrational exuberance speech--with the Dow at 6437.
Where do we go from way up here Some investors get vertigo peering down from the lofty height of Dow 10000. But to the standard-bearer of the bull market, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, the horizon looks clear for further gains. This is an economy that is doing quite well and we think will support an increase in stock prices, says Ms. Cohen, who marked Dow 10000 sipping tea in her office. But we don't think that the increase in stock prices will be at the same high rate. We are still quite bullish, but we aren't quite as exuberantly bullish. She says stocks have the green light unless government, corporations and individuals stop making the sensible decisions that have transformed the economy.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization issues rose, erasing intraday declines on a late-day wave of buying centered on the technology sector. The overall Nasdaq Stock Market also benefited from the late tech-sector rally, and the Nasdaq Composite Index posted the sharpest gain of the major stock-market indexes. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks advanced 1.11 points, or 0.28, to 398.74, and the Nasdaq composite gained 31.97 points, or 1.3, to 2493.37. Small-cap and Nasdaq stocks were confined to relatively narrow trading ranges throughout much of the thinly traded preholiday session, before jumping higher late in the day. The stock market is closed today in observance of Good Friday. For the holiday-shortened week, the Russell 2000 rose 4.82 points, or 1.2, and the Nasdaq composite was up 74.2 points, or 3.1.
NEW YORK -- Two high-tech initial public offerings presented more evidence of investors' preference for anything related to the Internet. Shares of Claimsnet.com Inc., an electronic-commerce company that helps health-care companies process transactions on the Internet, doubled in their first trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Meanwhile, PLX Technology Inc., which makes semiconductor devices and software and has a solid history of earnings and revenue growth, made a less impressive debut on the Nasdaq. Investors appeared willing to overlook the fact that Claimsnet.com is losing significant sums of money and is barely generating revenue. It's distressing, said David Menlow, president of the IPO Financial Network in Millburn, N.J. Analysts said the latest trend appears to be successful offerings from Internet companies that not only are posting losses, but hardly have revenues. PLX priced 3.3 million shares at 9 apiece, 1 above the projected sale price. The stock closed at 12.125. Claimsnet.com priced 2.5 million shares at 8, the midrange of the estimated spread of 7 to 9. The shares closed at 16.50.
At a huge team-building meeting last month for nearly all of Charles Schwab's 13,000 employees, Co-Chief Executive David S. Pottruck implored his troops to keep innovating in their jobs. We don't have time to build bridges to the next millennium, Mr. Pottruck declared in the speech at San Francisco's Moscone Center, where 5,000 employees watched in person the rest watched on a worldwide video feed. Mr. Pottruck also read inspirational email from employees. We take leaps. We leap across chasms into new and unexplored territory, he said. Lately, the same might be said of Schwab stock, which has fast become one of the signature stocks of today's Internet-charged stock market. In fact, Schwab -- which has the biggest online-brokerage operation -- is itself trading more like an Internet stock than a stodgy brokerage firm, without even having to add a dot.com or an exclamation point to its name. Shares of the San Francisco financial-services company have rocketed 91, splitadjusted, on the Big Board since the start of the year, to yesterday's record close of 107 14 , up 3 78 , as it has outshone other brokerage companies that have been around much longer. The stock has jumped 14 this week alone, amid a rally in online-brokerage-related shares.
Gillette provided the latest sobering news for a giddy stock market today, sending prices lower with a warning that it will fall short of analysts' expectations for first-quarter earnings. Gillette's announcement deflated the rally that had sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high Monday. The Dow fell 43.84 points today to close at 9963.49. Broader market indicators were mostly lower, although the Dow sustained the sharpest losses. Barry Hyman, analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said Gillette's bad news illustrated the recent split between the fortunes of the blue-chip companies and the Internet upstarts. This is a two-tiered market, he said. It has been for quite some time, and as long as the Gillettes, the Cokes, keep coming out with warnings, it will remain so. While the blue chips propelled the Dow past 10,000 for the first time in recent weeks, the market has appeared extremely vulnerable to signs of weakness from the corporate giants. Today, after Gillette said weakness in its Latin American business will cause it to miss analysts' expectations by 1 cent per share, its stock fell 7 34, to 50.
Loudoun County, the Washington region's fastest-growing county, also received a second distinction last year It was the hottest market for home sales. The average resale price of Loudoun County homes rose by 6.4 percent in 1998, the biggest gain within the region, according to the Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc. new-home sales aren't included. Population growth and rising home values typically go hand in hand in a suburban community like Loudoun County, the newest center of technology industry expansion in the Washington region. But the runner-up to the hottest market title may surprise you. That's right, the District of Columbia. The average resale price for District homes rose 4.9 percent last year, ahead of Prince William County 4.2 percent, Northern Virginia 3.6 percent, Montgomery County 3.2 percent, Frederick County 2.7 percent, Charles County 1.3 percent and Prince George's County 0.8 percent.
Small companies with swooning stocks sometimes are called Roach Motels -- you know, shareholders can check in, but not out, except at huge losses. But some buyout firms now are asking this Where can I get a room With the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks having plunged 16.1 since its peak a year ago, a gap has emerged between the market valuations of small and large companies. So buyout firms are starting to pore over financials of distinctly unglamorous small concerns with beaten-down stocks, then bidding to take them private. Recently, buyout firms have offered to take private this group of seemingly humdrum stocks an office-furniture maker, an outdoor-apparel concern, a small hotel company, a furniture-rental firm and a human-resources outsourcing firm. Huh Didn't Wall Street buyout firms make their names a decade ago from glamour buyouts of large conglomerates see Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s acquisition of RJR Nabisco
PHILADELPHIA -- When First Union Corp. took over Corestates Financial Corp. last year, Albert W. Mandia figured he'd be just another merger victim. After a 24-year career that had seen him rise to chief financial officer at Corestates, Mr. Mandia worried that his new employer would consider him extra baggage as a decade of downsizing climaxed with the loss of Philadelphia's last major bank. As he began looking for a new job in early 1998, he wasn't sure he would be able to stay in Philadelphia -- or in banking. Just a year later, Mr. Mandia is thriving in a corner of the financial-services industry that hardly even existed a decade ago. He is chief financial officer at Philadelphia-based American Business Financial Services Inc., a much smaller but fast-growing firm that makes retail loans to people with spotty credit records. Mr. Mandia represents a new class of employee who, thanks to a booming economy and tight labor market, is finding that there's not only life after downsizing, but opportunity, too. The Philadelphia banking scene is representative of a dynamic taking place in lots of industries. In the past, low unemployment levels and fast economic growth often made companies reluctant to lay off workers. Now, companies sometimes see layoffs as a source of growth as they reconfigure themselves to work more efficiently.
WASHINGTON -- Hoping to lure private capital back to emerging markets, the World Bank plans to provide guarantees to help poor countries sell bonds to international investors. The bank's board is expected on Tuesday to approve the new policy, which could last as long as two years. The partial guarantees, limited initially to a total of 2 billion, are intended to restore investor confidence in governments that adhere to sound economic policies but whose ability to borrow on international capital markets has been undermined by investor panic. That situation has been a common one during the financial upheaval of the past 20 months. The guarantee program, which could also apply to commercial-bank loans, is one component of a broader international effort to prevent and resolve financial crises. The bank, the International Monetary Fund and the rich countries that fund them are trying to make as much progress as possible on those initiatives in time for the World BankIMF spring meetings, here at the end of the month. A centerpiece of that effort is the search for ways to encourage private investors -- an increasing source of financing for developing countries during the 1990s -- to return to emerging-market bonds and to stay when things get shaky. The World Bank and IMF are walking a fine line. They don't want to bail out private investors who already receive high yields on emerging-market bonds because the investors are taking big risks. But the institutions also want to be sure that deserving emerging-market governments have access to private capital even when markets are nervous. World Bank guarantees would make the bonds less risky in exchange, investors presumably would accept lower interest rates.
The FBI arrested a 25-year-old computer engineer yesterday and accused him of originating a fake news story that swept across the World Wide Web last week and bid up the stock of a telecommunications equipment company. The suspect, Gary Dale Hoke of Raleigh, N.C., is an employee of the firm, PairGain Technologies Inc. Hoke was released on 50,000 bond yesterday. He faces a charge of securities fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a 1 million fine. A federal complaint and affidavit filed against Hoke said he created the fake Bloomberg News Web page that falsely reported that Tustin, Calif.-based PairGain was about to be bought by an Israeli company. The fake news story and e-mail messages touting the deal sparked a frenzy of trading in PairGain shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market on April 7. Word of impending acquisitions often leads investors to buy the target company's stock, on the assumption that they will be able to sell it for a better price. This buying, in turn, drives the price up. According to the affidavit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the FBI investigation showed that Hoke on April 7 used the Angelfire service, which allows people to design and post pages on the Web for free, for his bogus page.
One of the largest utility acquisitions in Massachusetts is supposed to provide a jolt to the economy. Shock is more like it, to hear the business community tell it. BEC Energy, which owns Boston Edison, said in December that it planned to acquire Commonwealth Energy System, which owns Commonwealth Electric Co., Commonwealth Gas Co. and Cambridge Electric Light Co., for 948 million. BEC Energy is paying a premium of 502 million over the book value of Commonwealth. Utility officials say the melding of the two operations would allow them to freeze rates for four years and create substantial operating efficiencies that would save customers billions of dollars. But to get there, the utilities want permission from regulators to make customers pay the combined company 959 million over 40 years for costs incurred as part of the acquisition. The utilities propose to collect 34.1 million a year for the first 10 years and 20.6 million annually for the remaining 30 years.
SkyTel Communications Inc.'s announcement this week that it had hired an investment banker underscores the troubles now gripping the once highflying world of paging. Although John Stupka, SkyTel's chief executive, declined to confirm that the company is for sale, some Wall Street analysts believe that the paging firm will be sold within 90 days. Potential buyers, say observers, include MCI WorldCom Inc., one of the country's largest telecommunications companies, which presumably would be interested in SkyTel's nationwide two-way messaging network. A spokesman for MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., declined to comment. Wall Street believes SkyTel will fetch as much as 1.5 billion, or about a 50 premium over the stock's current price. SkyTel closed up 50 cents at 15.6875 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday. Although SkyTel was the nation's first paging company to earn a quarterly profit, during its 10 years in business it has wracked up huge losses -- as have most paging companies. SkyTel has had to invest heavily in building its nationwide wireless messaging networks and on consumer marketing. But with more people buying cell phones and organizers such as Palm Pilots, the alert system associated with pagers seems increasingly simplistic. This has forced the beleaguered paging industry to reinvent itself. They need to find a match between their services and the new demands of consumers, says Steven Yanis, a wireless analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
U.S. involvement in the Balkan crisis has done nothing to weaken consumers' rosy outlook for the economy. The Conference Board said its monthly consumer-confidence index rose to 134.9 in April from 134.0 in March, reaching its highest level since last summer. Low unemployment and a booming stock market helped keep the gauge at lofty levels. I was looking for the number to fall in part because of the Kosovo crisis, said Tim Martin, senior economist for BankAmerica Corp. But consumers aren't too focused on the war in Kosovo, which is kind of surprising, because during the Gulf War, consumer confidence took a pretty severe beating. Meanwhile, sales of existing homes rose less than 1 in March as a strong economy and low mortgage rates continued to lure buyers. The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family homes changed hands at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million, compared with 5.02 million in February and up 3.7 from 4.87 million in March 1998. Sales rose slightly in the Midwest and West, while the Northeast fell slightly and the South was flat. The home-sales report also surprised economists, who had predicted home sales would drop about 2 from February's level. That forecast was based partly on a mortgage-application survey compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America that showed activity among purchase mortgages, a leading indicator for home sales, had slipped in recent weeks.
WASHINGTON -- Top U.S. financial regulators are expected to recommend that hedge funds disclose their portfolios' financial condition in quarterly filings that are available to the public, but they fell short of proposing broad new rules for the 300 billion industry. The regulators' review of hedge funds has resulted in at least eight legislative and regulatory recommendations aimed at tightening standards for banks and broker dealers that either lend to or take part in risky investments, many of which are common to hedge-fund portfolios. The recommendations are part of a report that will be released as early as today by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes top officials at the Treasury, Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. After the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management LP last fall, Congress asked the group to find the best way to control hedge funds, which have widely been blamed for aggravating financial crises around the world. Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment pools in which the participants are primarily wealthy individuals. Treasury officials outlined the report yesterday during a briefing for House Banking Committee members. Of the three recommendations that would require legislation, the proposal for new disclosures in hedge-fund quarterly filings would have the broadest impact on the industry.
MCI WorldCom Inc., fueled by growth in Internet traffic, data and old-fashioned phone calls, beat analysts' earnings expectations for the first quarter as revenue grew a healthy 15. But shares of the Jackson, Miss., telecommunications company continued to drop amid uncertainty over whether MCI WorldCom will make a bid for Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's last major independent wireless company. MCI WorldCom remains in talks with Nextel about a potential acquisition, but the two sides are said to be deadlocked over price. MCI WorldCom officials are reportedly growing concerned about the fall in their company's stock price as the talks continue. MCI WorldCom shares have lost more than 10 in value since April 12. On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, MCI closed at 83.875, down 3.8125. MCI WorldCom had net income of 709 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared with pro forma earnings of 191 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding MCI WorldCom's 19 interest in Brazil's Embratel Participacoes SA and a one-time gain, the company had operating earnings of 688 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the yearearlier pro forma results of 169 million, or 10 cents a share. Analysts had expected operating earnings of 34 cents a share, according to a consensus compiled by First Call Corp.
The influence of medical journals on biotechnology stocks is being demonstrated again, this time by a 75 percent jump in the shares of Digene Corp. of Beltsville over the past 2 12 weeks. In an study made public Monday, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that a test developed by Digene can identify some women at high risk for cervical cancer, eliminating the need for repeated testing. The JAMA article is the latest in a series of positive developments that has pushed Digene's stock from 6.87 12 a share on April 19 to 12.25 at the close of trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. For a time Tuesday, Digene's stock traded above 15 -- its highest level in more than a year. It has pulled back in the past couple of days, which often happens after a volatile technology stock suddenly spurts because of important developments. Digene's chief operating officer, Charles M. Fleischman, said he believes the stock has run up because people are starting to understand the full impact we can have as a growing business.
The unemployment rate in the District dropped to 7.2 percent in March from February's 7.4 percent, the best showing in eight years, as the economic recovery spread to nearly every section of the capital. Although the District's jobless rate remains more than three times that of the Washington suburbs' 2.1 percent rate in March, the capital's improvement is dramatic nonetheless. In March 1998, D.C. unemployment stood at 9.3 percent. The suburban figure is not adjusted for seasonal employment changes. Job gains at District offices and restaurants, consulting and law firms and retail outlets contributed to an increase of 3,800 private- sector jobs over the past year. There were 7,200 more D.C. residents at work this past March than in the same month a year earlier. Meanwhile, the number of unemployed D.C. residents declined to 19,000 in March from 24,700 a year earlier. The District's improvement comes in part from the updraft of a strong national economy and in part from the District's enhanced image, analysts noted.
It is quite a trick for something to grow larger and at the same time become more invisible. But that is what's happening to the health care problem in the United States. The greater the number of people without medical insurance, the less the politicians want to talk about it -- let alone deal with it. In 1992, when the plight of the uninsured became a major issue in the presidential campaign, there were 38 million non-covered Americans below Medicare age. Five years later, according to a report released last week, the number had grown by 5 million. And the rate of increase is accelerating, from an average of half a million annually in the first two years to an average of 1.2 million annually in the three most recent years. But last week, when the National Coalition on Health Care, a bipartisan group headed by former presidents Bush, Carter and Ford, put out its latest report on The Erosion of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, it barely made a ripple. Monica Lewinsky's appearance on Saturday Night Live drew more coverage than the fact that in the most recent year cited by the report, 1.7 million Americans were added to the ranks of the uninsured. Why is this happening The report's authors, Steven Findlay and Joel Miller -- who had the assistance of Tulane University's Kenneth Thorpe, probably the country's leading authority on this question -- say the legions of the uninsured are rising because of fundamental economic and demographic forces, which, by themselves, are certain to make the problem worse. The authors say that even if the rosy economic conditions prevalent since 1992 prevail for another decade, a projected 52 million to 54 million non-elderly Americans -- one in five -- will be uninsured in 2009. If a recession occurs, that number likely will jump to 61 million -- one in four. Most of the uninsured have jobs, but increasingly, they work in small businesses or in service sectors that either do not cover employees or require them to pay so much for health insurance that they cannot afford it. The growing numbers of self-employed, part- timers and contract workers swell the totals.
In a corner of a nondescript, red-brick building here are dozens of boxes emblazoned with Compaq Computer Corp.'s familiar red logo. The boxes contain printed circuit boards and related accessories for Compaq's high-end computer servers. The tops of the boxes show a return shipping location for Compaq at the address here. But this is not a Compaq factory. Rather, it is one of 21 high- tech manufacturing plants that form the global manufacturing empire of a Silicon Valley company named Solectron Corp. Most people have never heard of Solectron, or of the curious mix of state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and ancient Asian principles by which it operates. The name Solectron does not appear on any product. What Solectron makes is nonetheless very familiar cell phones, inkjet printers, personal computers and medical equipment that bear the names and logos of a virtual who's who of high tech -- International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc., Nortel Networks Corp. and others that would rather not reveal who is building their products. We are their factory, said Gary Fain, the Solectron manager who oversees the Compaq assembly line. We've got their name on it, but they never touch it.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks rose, with the two groups -- like much of the stock market-shaking off initial skittishness over the resignation of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. The small-cap market, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, posted somewhat steeper gains than the overall stock market, while the Nasdaq market posted the sharpest gains of the major stock-market indexes. The strength of the small-cap and Nasdaq markets was again fueled by the technology sector, with last week's sell-off quickly becoming little more than a fleeting memory. Within the overall technology sector, a broad range of industry groups posted significant gains. The Nasdaq computer index rose 1.97. The Chicago Board Options Exchange computer-software index was up 2.3, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index rose 4.4, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index added 1.6. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gained 2.45, or 0.55, to 449.26, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 2606.54, advanced 39.86, or 1.55.
Sen. Richard C. Shelby R-Ala. will review the Federal Reserve Bank's role in overseeing a small California bank suspected of being a possible conduit in the mid-1990s for illegal Chinese political contributions. Shelby, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, already has said he will review if another federal bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was negligent in its oversight of the bank, the Far East National Bank of Los Angeles. The Fed approved the sale of the bank to a foreign bank in Taiwan in June 1997, the same month the Fed knew the OCC was notifying the Justice Department and other criminal investigators of the bank's activities. Cox Communications agreed to buy TCA Cable TV for about 4 billion in stock, cash and assumed debt, moving to become the fourth-largest company in the rapidly consolidating U.S. cable television industry. TCA has 883,000 subscribers, mainly in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Cox -- which last month agreed to buy Media General's cable systems for 1.4 billion -- and many of its competitors have been on an acquisition spree in the past year, seeking to build larger regional groups of subscribers to spread out the cost of new programming and digital services such as high-speed Internet access and local telephone service. Bank fraud charges were filed against 33 people in federal court in Manhattan for using false papers to apply for more than 35 million in loans from Citibank, Chase Manhattan and five other banks. The defendants, mostly small-business owners, got the bogus documents from a former NatWest Bank loan officer who has already pleaded guilty. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the banks actually lent out about 20 million based on the papers and lost 10 million to 15 million. Avondale Industries said its board has authorized management to begin talks with Litton Industries over Litton's 500 million cash offer to purchase the New Orleans shipyard. Litton has made twin, unsolicited offers for Avondale and Newport News Shipbuilding, which also has an offer pending for Avondale. While Litton is offering cash for Avondale, Newport News has offered its stock in a bid valued at about 470 million. Newport News has not publicly responded to the bid from Litton. Insight Communications said it plans to raise more than 500 million through an initial public offering of Class A common stock. The cable TV system operator did not disclose the number of shares or estimated price range in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It plans to use proceeds from the IPO to acquire systems in Kentucky, introduce new and enhanced products and services and invest in a telephone venture with AT&T.
NEW YORK -- The dollar finished slightly lower against the yen and euro, barely reacting to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to tilt toward raising U.S. interest rates. In the longer term, the bias toward higher rates, disclosed after the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting panel, is expected to help the dollar continue its climb against the yen and keep it strong against the euro. After trading flat for most of the session in New York, the dollar at first edged higher against the yen and euro on the FOMC announcement before sliding for a muted reaction overall. The dollar has gained three yen since May 10 on the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese bond yields, so the FOMC's announcement does lend support to that interest-rate differential, said Susan Stearns, foreign-exchange director at the Bank of Montreal in New York. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expects the Japanese economy to contract by 0.9 in 1999, compared with its earlier estimate of 0.2 growth. The yen also is pressured by speculation that rallies in Japanese stocks are near their limits, after a rise of more than 20 in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average since January.
BUENOS AIRES -- Four months after Brazil's devaluation, Argentina's recession drags on as companies struggle with high costs and a U.S. dollar-pegged exchange-rate system that many believe is still essential to economic stability. Despite weakened currencies in just about every major Latin American economy in the past five years, Argentina has hung on doggedly to its link to the dollar. The so-called Convertibility Plan, in which the dollar peg plays a key part, extinguished Argentine inflation and provided a base of stability that allowed the economy to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8 between 1991 and 1998. But because the dollar peg means Argentina can't weaken its currency to make its exports more competitive, it has to find ways to lower the cost of production. Economists say the government hasn't complemented the currency system with policies that lower costs for businesses, and that may be delaying economic recovery. If the government is going to say that convertibility is a sacred cow, they have to build competitiveness, says Pedro Lacoste, whose Buenos Aires economic-research firm bears his name. It's a tough agenda with powerful interests against it. But whoever the next finance minister is, he better be very convinced about these issues. In the early 1990s, Argentina increased competitiveness, Mr. Lacoste says, by slashing export taxes and liberalizing port regulations. But the government's attention now seems to be diverted by political shadow plays in a presidential election year. Some new tax policies appear to be working against competitiveness. In an announcement of default yesterday, power generator Central Termica Guemes SA said it wouldn't make a 3.6 million interest payment in part because of new taxes levied by the Argentine government on assets and on cash interest payments. Mr. Lacoste estimates that gross domestic product will fall 3 this year, while exports decline around 12. Yesterday, the government said auto production fell 51 in April from the same month a year earlier electricity consumption fell 9 in the same period. The government and some economists were betting on a recovery in the second quarter it is just not happening yet, says Martin Lousteau, an economist who works with Mr. Lacoste.
Stocks rallied at the end of an erratic session as investors pondered their next move after the Federal Reserve's warning on inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.44 to close at 10,887.39 after changing direction several times during the session. Broader stock indicators also closed higher after struggling all day to chart a course. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.91, to 1344.23, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 19.04, to 2577.40. Everyone has adopted a wait-and-see attitude, said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga. On Tuesday, the Dow fell 16.52, recovering from a 112-point slide that followed the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. But a warning from the Fed that rates are likely to rise if inflation reawakens left the market jittery today.
Major Latin American markets, under pressure earlier this week from rumors about Argentina's currency, rebounded. But the mood remains cautious following the U.S. Federal Reserve's shift to a bias in favor of tightening interest rates. The currency rumors, immediately denied by the Argentine government, were further dispelled late Wednesday when a former economy minister denied having said Argentina should float the peso anytime soon. Domingo Cavallo's calming words helped lift Argentina's Merval Index 1.2, partially offsetting a 4.3 decline during Wednesday's session. Mexico's IPC Index bounced back 1.2. But another interest-rate cut in Brazilits fourth in three weeks-failed to inject much life into the Bovespa, which was flat for most of yesterday's session. That suggests to some investors this highflying market could have reached an inflection point, where anticipated interest-rate cuts will no longer automatically power the Bovespa higher. This the first time I can remember that the Brazil market failed to go up after good news, said Stephen Oler, senior portfolio manager for Latin America at Putnam Investments in Boston. It means that the market may need to consolidate before resuming its advance. In other markets, Asian stocks enjoyed a slight rebound of their own, though South Korea's Kospi Index continued to slide. European stocks, led by the telecommunications sector, propped up most major markets.
Taped to the side of Jose Gabriel Gonzalez's snack cart is a handwritten note asking, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE CANAL NOW The question testifies to his anxiety about what will happen after Dec. 31, when the United States pulls out the last of its troops and the Panama Canal comes under full Panamanian control. I have great worries, said Gonzalez, whose cart occupies a busy street corner here. I have lost my sense of security. I have never known Panama without the Americans being here. Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate. Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero. In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent. Some polls have even found that a majority of Panamanians would like the United States to retain control of the 50-mile-long canal, or, at least, operate it in partnership with Panama similar to the current arrangement.
If the Redskins or the Capitals had gone on the block a decade ago, there might have been some Washingtonians among the bidders. But we wouldn't have seen the likes of Daniel Snyder or Ted Leonsis. That's because Snyder, who runs a fast-growing Bethesda marketing firm and is in line to buy the Redskins, and Leonsis, an executive of America Online Inc. and future majority owner of the Capitals, represent something remarkably new in the Washington region an entrepreneurial class with widespread wealth based on a record- setting stock market and a giant wave of technological innovation. It's too early to guess what this affluence means for the local economy and the local culture. But assuming the sales of the two teams go forward, we will soon see what happens when two of the city's most visible institutions wind up in the hands of a new breed of aggressive, impatient-for-success entrepreneurs. Of course there were moguls of great wealth here before America went online in the mid-1990s. But fundamentally, Washington was a world capital where business took a back seat to politics. Its economy was anchored in real estate, banking and federal jobs, contracts and lobbying. Fortunes tended to grow incrementally and to be handled conservatively. That's all changed now. The 1990-91 recession mowed down much of the Washington region's old business leadership and in its place has come a younger, opportunistic crowd. It's a clan with gobs of money, a group that seems determined to spend, invest and enjoy its wealth with the urgency and personal involvement with which that wealth was accumulated.
WASHINGTON -- Forecasters surveyed quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia expect the economy to grow faster this year than they did previously, but they don't expect inflation to be any worse this year. The median of the 37 forecasts is for the U.S. economy to expand at an annual rate of 3.2 in the current quarter, 2.8 in the third quarter and 2.7 in the fourth three months ago, they were predicting inflation-adjusted growth rates of 2.7, 1.9 and 2.4, respectively. After a hiccup in consumer prices in the current quarter because of higher oil prices, the economists expect consumer-price inflation to calm to a 2.1 pace in 1999 and rise slightly to 2.3 in 2000, the same as they did in a February survey. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect 2.5 annual increases in the consumer-price index. But the Philadelphia Fed cautioned that two-thirds of the new forecasts were received before the government reported a surprisingly sharp increase in the CPI in April. As they have in previous surveys, the forecasters said they expect the year 2000 computer glitch to increase inflation-adjusted growth by an average of 0.3 percentage point this year and shave 0.3 point off growth early next year. As a result, the forecasters expect the economy to slow to a 1.8 growth rate in the first quarter of 2000 and then to rebound to a 3.0 pace in the second.
A husband, father and entrepreneur with more responsibilities than he cares to count, Marshall Lane is happy to see his pile of bills getting shorter as he hacks away at credit-card debt. In 1996, Mr. Lane and his wife, Jannicke Kolderup-Lane, carried a combined credit-card balance of about 20,000. Three years later, that balance has been cut in half. We're at a point where we could pay it off if we wanted to, said the 31-year-old San Francisco art dealer. He may not know it, but Mr. Lane -- and others like him -- is beginning to demonstrate a new level of prudence in personal finance that could have broad implications for the U.S. economy. For years, economists warned that a high level of consumer debt was the Achilles' heel of an otherwise athletic economy. Overextended consumers, they pointed out, would be forced to use an ever-growing share of household income to pay credit-card bills, leaving little to support consumer spending. And if consumer spending slowed, they bemoaned, so would the economy. Yet in recent months, the statistics on the consumer debt front have shown signs of improvement. The pace of new debt has slowed significantly, delinquencies and charge-off rates are falling sharply and the amount of revolving credit outstanding declined in the first quarter. Reducing credit-card debt, say economists, could be the first step to raising the U.S.'s low rates of saving.
NEW YORK -- Be cautious. Be smart. This is the options market's advice to stock investors. With few people interested in adding to, or opening, positions, sentiment was slightly bearish, representing a shift from the previous week's listless mood when most traders watched everything from the safety of the sidelines. As traders say, 'It's a heavy market.' It's for sale, a specialist at the American Stock Exchange said. The change in confidence was caused by a confluence of events including another sell-off in the technology and Internet sectors, an analysts' downgrade to sell from hold for bank stocks and lingering concerns about interest rates and inflation. No one's making money-long or short, the head of a major options-trading desk said.
German and British stocks dropped as fallout from U.S. interest-rate concerns spread from emerging markets to the more mature markets of Europe. Taking their cue from sharp declines in U.S. stocks on Monday, London's FTSE 100 Index fell 1.2 to 6249.3, while in Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX Index declined 88.05 points, or 1.7 to 5165.72. Only four components of the blue-chip DAX index managed to end the day higher. European markets slumped even though the Continent is unlikely to face the same threat of higher interest rates that U.S. investors now confront. Indeed, last month European central bankers slashed key lending rates, while Federal Reserve policy makers have shifted their bias in favor of raising rates in the U.S. Looking at European equities in isolation, there's little reason to be concerned about valuations or earnings, said Ian Scott, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. The threats to Europe come from outside the Continent. Meanwhile, Brazilian stocks were pummeled for the second consecutive session that together have trimmed nearly 10 of the market's value. The benchmark Bovespa Index closed down 552.43 to 10602.10, ruffled by interest-rate concerns and yet another market rumor, this time allegations linking President Fernando Cardoso to a recent privatization controversy.
Uncertainty about interest rates and economic growth, ahead of a long holiday weekend, pushed stocks to some of their sharpest declines this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 235.23, or 2.20, to 10466.93, the year's heaviest drop in point terms and thirdheaviest in percentage terms. Leading the way down were the old-style manufacturing stocks that had soared in April, as well as the banking stocks. Even considering that point moves in the industrial average aren't as significant, in percentage terms, as when the index was at lower levels in past years, this has been a volatile week. There have been three drops of more than 100 points, including yesterday, and one gain Wednesday's 171.07-point rally. Some investors were locking in profits yesterday by selling winners ahead of what is expected to be quiet pre-MemorialDay trading today. International Business Machines, which had soared on Wednesday in advance of a stock split, declined. But Nasdaq-listed semiconductor stocks such as Intel posted gains, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell just 8.03, or 0.33, to 2419.15. News that the Nasdaq Stock Market plans to extend trading into the evening hours helped buoy that index. Investors continued to worry about last week's announcement from the Federal Reserve that it is leaning toward raising interest rates. A variety of analysts warned that a Fed move could come as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for June 29 and 30. Bonds fell on those concerns and on reports that foreign central banks were selling U.S. bonds. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond declined 2032, or 6.25 for every 1,000 in bond face value. That pushed the yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, up to 5.842.
Texas' unemployment rate is hovering around 4, so the state's fund for unemployment benefits ought to be flush with cash, right Think again. In the past year, the unemployment trust fund has seen a dramatic rise in the size of monthly benefit payments. Total payments in the first quarter of 1999 jumped 42 to about 312 million from 219 million in the same period last year. At the same time, the monthly balance of the fund has decreased. As of last week, officials project the fund at the end of May will have a balance of about 847 million, 13 below the May 1998 balance. Oddly, the trend is partly due to the state's healthy economy, which is in some ways aggravating the effect of Oil Patch and other layoffs that account for the shrinking fund balances. If current trends continue, the fund by this fall could drop so far that there will be little or no new money to transfer to the state's worker-training programs. It also could reach the level that would trigger an automatic increase in the unemployment insurance premiums paid by employers. This outlook is, of course, subject to change an unexpected drop in the number of people collecting jobless benefits would enable the fund to build back up. But the trend is unmistakable. In their latest projection, officials with the Texas Workforce Commission say the trust fund will have a balance of 651 million on Oct. 1, excluding money tentatively set aside for job training as recently as March, officials projected a balance of 756 million.
NEW YORK -- The dollar fell against the yen and euro in line with early declines in stocks and bonds, after a stronger-than-expected manufacturing report increased speculation Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the economy. While the Dow Jones Industrials Average ended up, it spent most of the day in negative territory. As U.S. assets show weakness, there are certain concerns by market participants about whether the U.S. is the place to put money, said Jeffrey Yu, vice president at Sanwa Bank in New York. The idea is, the U.S. can't get any better so it's time to sell some dollars. The dollar's recent declines put it more than four yen below its 1999 high of 124.75 yen reached less than two weeks ago. But in the view of Alex Beuzelin, market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington, it is still too early to tell whether sentiment on the dollar has shifted. The U.S. economy continues to grow. Inflation pressures so far remain benign, he said. With the implication of tighter Fed policy, the dollar tends to track stocks and bonds. But over the medium term and longer term, higher interest rates are dollar-supportive, he added.
The euro was meant to bring Europe closer together. These days, it seems to be doing the opposite. The common currency, already caught in a major slide, is becoming the cause of heated political finger-pointing. The Germans blame the Italians for lack of budgetary backbone. The Dutch head of the European Central Bank faults the Germans for failing to kick-start their economy. And currency traders are voting with their feet. The big question is whether the euro is going through normal growing pains -- or facing a major crisis. The answer may be a bit of both. Yesterday, the euro hit another low, trading for as little 1.0326 on uncertainty over Kosovo and prospects for higher U.S. interest rates. In late New York trading, the euro traded for 1.0358. There was extensive debate before European economic and monetary union that it would be difficult to have a single currency for this region, says Thomas Mayer, European economist with Goldman, Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt. This has just all become clear much earlier than expected, he said. Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank, yesterday played down concerns about the euro's drop, stressing the euro-zone's favorable inflation outlook. The euro is a currency firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger external value, Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference after the ECB governing council's regular meeting. The ECB held interest rates steady, as expected.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Alice M. Rivlin said she is resigning from the Fed after three years in the job, effective July 16. As is the custom at the Fed, Ms. Rivlin won't participate in the June 29-30 meeting of Fed policy makers. That removes one potential voice against raising interest rates. At least until recently, Ms. Rivlin has emphasized the enormous social benefits of a strong economy and has strongly advocated holding rates steady. The resignation means the Clinton administration now has two vacancies to fill on the seven-member board. The vice chairman's title may help the recruitment effort. For one of the two slots, the White House is leaning toward nominating Carol J. Parry, an executive vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank in charge of mortgage and commercial loans to low- and moderate-income communities and of the bank's philanthropy. Ms. Parry had rejected earlier overtures. Ms. Rivlin, 68 years old, said she will return to the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank where she spent most of the Reagan and Bush years, and hopes to spend more time with her three grandchildren. However, she will continue to head the board overseeing the District of Columbia's finances. I hope to spend more time and to be more effectively involved in the city than I have been able to be while at the Fed, she said in her letter of resignation. Ms. Rivlin's four-year term as vice chairman was to expire in June 2000, though her term as a member of the Fed board extended to 2010. She had been overseeing Fed administrative operations and the Fed's oversight of bank payment systems.
The price rise of theglobe.com's stock on its first day of trading last Nov. 13 was the most spectacular ever for an initial public offering. But the trading session also was one of the messiest ever on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Theglobe.com was priced the night before at 9 a share. The next morning, there was a crush of demand. At the opening, some investors bought it for 96 to 97 a share from Mayer & Schweitzer Inc., a unit of Charles Schwab Corp. At the same time, underwriter Bear Stearns Cos. was selling shares for 90, and someone sold it on Instinet Corp.'s screen-based trading system for 87. The apparent result Some buyers overpaid or some sellers sold too low. The controversial opening illustrates the structural problems plaguing Nasdaq. Though it once boasted of being the stock market for the next hundred years, Nasdaq's inability so far to resolve these issues could make it vulnerable to competition from upstart electronic exchanges and, perhaps soon, from the New York Stock Exchange, too. By all accounts, the 1997 reforms that followed an investigation into dealers' alleged fixing of stock prices made Nasdaq a fairer market. But those reforms, coupled with advances in electronic trading, are fragmenting Nasdaq into many submarkets, making it harder to ensure that buyers and sellers are getting the best price. It's an absolute Frankenstein, Douglas Atkin, chief executive officer of Instinet, said at a conference in March. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent, thought it had a solution last year to this problem a central limit order book into which investors and dealers from around the country could funnel orders. Big brokerage firms and institutional investors backed it as an essential step. But some firms saw it as proof that NASD management was bent on competing with its own members. Seeing a threat to their livelihoods, those members fought and killed the proposal.
NEW YORK -- Volatility rose sharply as options traders hedged stock portfolios and took profits as the long bond's yield rose above 6. With the exception of precious metals, most sectors declined as Wall Street sweated in front of today's release of the producer-price index. Traders are worried the report could be stronger than expected, which would give the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee more of a reason to raise interest rates when it meets at the end of June. There's a real fear out there that we could have a very aggressive Fed, a trader at a top Wall Street firm said. In anticipation of an interest-rate increase, traders reconsidered stock prices and defensively traded options. Taking coin and running, is how a floor broker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange described the session. The option market's fear gauge, the CBOE's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 1.19, or 4.9, to 25.39, below its intraday high of 27.35.
Inflation fears ruled the markets again, driving down stocks and bonds as investors await price reports to be released today and Wednesday. With the producer-price index to be announced this morning and the more important consumer price number due Wednesday, investors were taking few chances. Despite a late-day rebound, Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 69.02, or 0.65, at 10621.27. Other indexes also fell. The industrials now are 4.37 below the year's high, but still up 15.68 for 1999. The day's big news was that Japan's economy returned to growth in the January-to-March quarter. Instead of welcoming the sign of world recovery, investors worried it will stoke inflation. That reinforced the view the Fed will boost benchmark interest rates June 30. The expected rate boost, together with the launch of new corporate-bond issues, pulled money out of Treasury bonds. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond declined 1532, or 4.688 for each 1,000 in face value, pushing the yield up to 6.059, its highest level since April 1998. The dollar was mixed. All eyes are on Friday morning right now, said Brian Conroy, head of listed trading at J.P. Morgan. He attributed the late rebound to short sellers, investors who bet on stock declines, who bought stocks to close out their bets before the inflation news hits.
Economists have all sorts of sophisticated measures of how the economy is doing, but sometimes the best indicator results from something as simple as a shopping trip. For Cynthia Latta, principal U.S. economist for Standard & Poor's DRI, a moment of clarity came when she went to a mall recently and didn't see a single sign advertising a sale. I just turned around and walked out, she said, making a mental note that the lack of customer incentives was a sign that store owners had plenty of business without cutting prices, a telltale tip that the economy continues to boom. What Latta saw at the mall was reinforced by reams of data that show that consumers, who account for fully two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, continue to spend at a pace that is remarkable eight years into an economic expansion. Sales of cars and light trucks are booming, as are sales at chain such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and Co. Yesterday, government figures showed that retail sales jumped a full 1 percent in May, up from just a 0.4 percent increase in April and no increase in March.
EBay, the boisterous online auction community and one of the signature successes among Internet commerce firms, was felled by a technical problem late Thursday that lasted about 22 hours. Investors, however, were not pleased by the disruption. Shares of eBay Inc., one of Wall Street's highest Internet high-flyers over the last year, fell 16.81 14 yesterday to close at 165.87 12. The San Jose company had notified customers throughout the day about efforts to fix the problem. We're sorry, but the eBay system is temporarily unavailable, it had said on a portion of the site that still worked. At about 830 p.m., it said We believe we isolated the problem, and we will keep a vigilant watch. Shortly after that, service was restored. But that was small consolation to eBay's more than 2 million participants -- purveyors of Beanie Babies, pink can openers, antique candy boxes and an array of items culled from the nations' attics. EBay typically has more than 2.2 million items up for bid at any given time. When the site first crashed at about 11 p.m. Thursday, Sharon Doney of Severn was auctioning 10 vintage jazz and classical music LPs on eBay. Doney sells 600 to 900 a month at online auctions, making such sales a primary source of her household income. But in recent weeks Doney has grown frustrated with frequent crashes at eBay. The site went down for six hours Wednesday, seven hours May 20 and four hours May 3. Because of eBay's problems, Doney said she has diversified her online selling by using other online auction venues such as Yahoo and Amazon.com. If I were only selling on eBay, I would be panicking at this point, Doney said.
MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government will announce today an 11 billion financing package aimed at building confidence that the country can survive next year's presidential election without suffering an economic crisis. The heart of the package, officials said, is a new 4.2 billion International Monetary Fund standby loan, to be disbursed over 18 months, that the fund's board is expected to approve shortly after recent lengthy negotiations. The package will also include commitments by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, some previously announced, as well as the longexpected renewal of an estimated 6.8 billion in swap lines with the U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and Canada's central bank. The swap arrangement dates back many years and was strengthened in the 1994 peso crisis when Canada and the U.S., Mexico's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and commercial banks supported Mexico's faltering economy with 47 billion in emergency financing. A Finance Ministry spokesman said late yesterday he couldn't confirm details. An IMF official in Washington, however, confirmed that a deal had been struck and said the Mexicans would probably draw on the funds. Countries sometimes secure IMF lending agreements to calm financial markets, but don't actually draw on the money.
Mexico said yesterday that it had lined up more than 20 billion in loans and lines of credit that it might tap in an effort to ensure economic stability during next year's presidential election. The loans, which include some that were previously pledged and others that renew existing credit lines, come from the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. and Canadian governments, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. The money is aimed at keeping President Ernesto Zedillo's six-year term from ending the way nearly all of his recent predecessors' terms have ended -- in a panicky flight by investors and lenders fearful that the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. In many past election years, the government has gone on spending binges aimed at winning support for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. This will provide us with the conditions necessary to have an orderly economic transition at the end of the six-year administration, Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of Mexico's central bank, said at a news conference in Mexico City. The move comes amid nervousness in financial markets that next year's elections, which are expected to be hotly contested, could be afflicted by the sort of political instability, economic mismanagement and capital flight that caused the peso to plunge in 1994, weeks after Zedillo's electoral victory. The peso crisis rocked global markets and prompted the Clinton administration to lead a 50 billion bailout for Mexico that sparked criticism on Capitol Hill. The administration, the IMF and their allies contend that this time around, Mexico is in much better economic shape and will use its international support to buttress sensible policies. The government has won praise from economists for keeping its budget and trade deficits under control, and Zedillo has sworn to keep from repeating the mistakes of his predecessors. The loans are designed to guard against a sudden loss of investor confidence by providing the government with extra resources if the need arises and by assuring markets the government is sticking to a sound policy path.
WALKING SHOES are strong sellers, although the category is tough to define. The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, North Palm Beach, Fla., says sales of walking shoes rose 1.3 in 1998, while overall sales of athletic footwear fell nearly 8. The trade group adds that walking remains popular as a fitness activity. But it's hard to say just what shoes people are buying to walk in, says Mike May, a spokesman for the group. Choices range from white athletic shoes to dressier brown specialty shoes. Retailers note that the sales trend, while not new, is accelerating, and manufacturers are adding fashion brands. Travelers who want a cozy, crossover shoe for trips are a factor, they say. New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. in Boston reports a huge surge in walking-shoe sales in the first quarter -- up 55 from a year earlier. Adele Rubinstein, manager of a Footprints Footwear store in Royal Oaks, Mich., says sales are brisk at the shop, which specializes in brands such as Mephisto, Rockport and Birkenstock. In Seattle, Nordstrom says the chain has been building its walking-shoe stock since this past fall. DKNY plans to introduce a Comfort line this fall that includes, among other features, antibacterial linings. A PEACHY CROP in Georgia spells good news for farmers there.
Some non-Internet stocks that managed to crash the Internet party have been finding that they, too, have got a splitting hangover. Take CheckFree Holdings. The Norcross, Ga., company earns most of its money from electronic bill-payment services and from software used by financial institutions, businesses that existed long before the Internet. But CheckFree's Internet bill-paying service is growing rapidly. Around the start of the year, investors embraced CheckFree as a back-door play on the blazing-hot Internet. By April 14, the stock soared to an intraday high of 69 18, up from 23 38 at the end of 1998. Since then, CheckFree has continued trading like an Internet stock It fell like a rock to as low as 33 58, and closed yesterday at 38 38, up 1 18 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This 44 decline -- despite a recent rebound in sympathy with the Internet stocks -- is a bit steeper than those of Internet bellwethers America Online and Yahoo in the same period. That is even though CheckFree, unlike them, has plenty of non-Internet revenue and -- egad -- even non-Internet earnings, to buoy it. Since the air started leaking out of the Internet bubble in April, it has been something of a mixed blessing for companies once tagged as backdoor plays on the Internet. Such companies can still garner a higher price-earnings ratio than run-of-the-mill enterprises with no Internet connection.
Today, the boomer generation worries about amassing enough money for retirement. Tomorrow will bring another worry how to make a limited pool of savings last for life. That's where annuities come in--the type known as immediate pay. These annuities guarantee you a permanent income, no matter how long you live. They have some drawbacks. But insurers are starting to rethink immediate-pay annuities to make them more salable--especially annuities linked to the performance of stocks. You buy an immediate-pay annuity with a lump sum of money. The funds might come from regular savings, stock market gains, a retirement plan, even the cash in a life insurance policy. The insurer will turn that money into a lifetime income. The income could also cover the joint lifetimes of you and your spouse. Neither of you would ever run out of cash, no matter how long you lived.
NEW YORK -- Qwest Communications International Inc. is close to increasing its bids for U S West Inc. and Frontier Corp., according to people close to the situation. Although the situation is fluid, Qwest's board is scheduled to meet this morning to consider various options to increase the unsolicited offers it made for U S West, a Denver-based Bell company, and Frontier, a Rochester, N.Y., long-distance company, on June 14. To be sure, the board can decide to remain pat. Qwest's bids for the companies were at first financially superior to those made by their original suitor, Global Crossing Ltd. But the value of the bids fell as Qwest's stock dropped as much as 25 last week. The stock of the Denver longdistance company has since rallied back a bit as its chief executive, Joseph P. Nacchio, has sought to explain the reasoning behind his bids to investors. Qwest's shares closed yesterday at 35.3125, down 1.3125, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. But in recent days, there has been little difference in the financial value of the bids from Qwest and Global Crossing. Accordingly, the boards of Frontier and U S West have both voted to stick with their original agreements with Global Crossing, having little incentive to go with Qwest. Subsequently, the pressure is building for Qwest's Mr. Nacchio to either walk away from his offer or put more money or stock on the table. People close to the situation say that Qwest could increase its offer for one or both companies, or put a collar on the deal that guarantees shareholders of U S West or Frontier a minimum share price. Such a move could ease concerns about Qwest's volatile stock, a factor the U S West board raised when it turned down Qwest's bid late Monday.
While bond investors were turning gloomy, investors in technology stocks perked up. Worries about Federal Reserve plans for interest rates at next week's meeting depressed Treasury bonds and most stocks in another day of lackluster stock trading. But tech stocks bucked the trend again, amid hopes that earnings gains will offset any rate increase. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 17.86 points, or 0.69, to 2598.12, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was falling 54.77, or 0.51, to 10666.86. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 232, or 10.625 per 1,000 bond, pushing the yield up to 6.140. The dollar was mixed. The bond is weighing heavily on stocks, said Bill Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. You've had a couple of good earnings reports, notably from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs Group, and it seems that the sell tickets are stamped and ready to be entered in anticipation. Both stocks fell despite beating earnings estimates.
Smith, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, closed on a house purchase in Alexandria Thursday. His mortgage A one-year adjustable at 5.25 percent. Why a one-year Because, unlike many other housing economists, Smith thinks fixed-rate mortgage rates will go down this year and into the next. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce next week that it will raise a key interest rate -- the benchmark federal funds rate -- to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. And when the Fed plays around with interest rates, the conversation around Washington dinner party tables inevitably turns to mortgages. But nobody needs to worry, Smith said. Contrary to what many Wall Street analysts are predicting, Smith believes that mortgage interest rates, still quite low by historical standards despite their upward drift in recent months, will go down later this year. Rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage should be down around 6 percent by the end of this year, plus or minus a bit, he said. The Mortgage Bankers Association sees a downward trend as well, although not as significant a dip as Smith predicts.
With the sort of attention usually reserved for royal weddings, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve convenes today and tomorrow to determine whether or not to leave the current federal funds rate unchanged. In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point. Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation. After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation Will tomorrow be the start of another long march, a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them -- Why has inflation continued to decelerate Is it due to a string of one-time favorable shocks, such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices Has that string run out
NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasurys surged as investors and traders adjusted positions ahead of important events this week, ranging from a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers to a Labor Department update on employment growth. Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 2732, or 8.4375 for each 1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 6.090 from 6.158 late Friday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. Today, in what likely will be the main focus for the bond market, Fed officials begin a two-day meeting to discuss monetary policy. People in the market expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan recently cited the need for a pre-emptive policy. Most analysts expect the Fed to raise its target for the federal funds rate, or the rate financial institutions pay on overnight loans, by a quarter percentage point. Yesterday, as people fine-tuned positions ahead of the Fed meeting, the market saw a technical rebound, said Dennis Hynes, chief market strategist at R.W. Pressprich & Co., New York.
In a year when the Real Thing took a beating, timing was everything. Many beverage analysts were caught flat-footed when Coca-Cola's growth rate started to fizzle because of turmoil in overseas markets. Coca-Cola, a perennially popular stock, rose 33 from January to July and then lost nearly its entire gain in the second half of the year. The company's 1.4 gain for the year, including reinvested dividends, helped depress the overall return for many a stock picker. Unless you were Timothy Swanson, a 32-year-old analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. Mr. Swanson was able to catch the wave of buoyant optimism for Coca-Cola in the first half of the year, before cutting his rating in mid-July, capturing a nifty 31 return. And in August, when many investors were bailing out of the stock of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the company's largest bottler, Mr. Swanson saw it as a cheap buy, riding that stock for 36 before jumping off. As a result, the three-time All-Star's 36 estimated overall return easily trumped the 11 median return for the 14 analysts evaluated in the survey. To a great extent, Mr. Swanson's calls were based on macroeconomic trends. With one international economy after another falling into recession, he felt that Coca-Cola, which gets 75 of its earnings from foreign markets, was too vulnerable. It had a great run, and it was time to take a respite, says Mr. Swanson, who likes to compete in triathlons.
If the Federal Reserve, as expected, raises short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point tomorrow, many consumers, homeowners and smaller businesses will shortly be paying more when they borrow -- but not much more. Banks likely will boost their 7.75 percent prime lending rates by the same quarter-point. Tied to the prime are rates for many home- equity loans, credit-card balances and small-business loans. I think you would see an industrywide increase of a quarter-point by the end of the week, said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at BankBoston. The Fed would expect that and want to see it as well. But even on a 20,000 loan, that would be only an added 50 in interest over the course of a year, some or all of which may be tax- deductible. In terms of impact on the booming U.S. economy, however, that 50 would be just the tiniest tip of a very big iceberg.
Hoping to see a summer rally after the Federal Reserve does its interest-rate deed today, investors bid stocks up again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 160.20 points, or 1.5, to 10815.35, its third consecutive gain. The Nasdaq Composite Index, full of rebounding technology stocks, surged 39.67 points, or 1.5, to 2642.11. It stands 9.94 points, or 0.4, short of its April 26 record close of 2652.05. Bonds rose again, and the dollar was mixed. The market's strength really caught most of us by surprise given that the Fed is widely expected to raise its guideline interest rates this afternoon, said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at Baltimore mutual-fund group T. Rowe Price. I guess the market is saying, We are already comfortable with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday,' he said. But if it is more than that, I think it would be kind of a shock. It is another sign of the market being very comfortable with how Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan orchestrates this whole process. He telegraphs well. The Fed's policy-making committee has been meeting yesterday and today, and any interest-rate announcement is expected at about 215 p.m. EDT.
NEW YORK -- In the end, it was the dollar that suffered most from the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain a neutral stance toward further fiscal tightening, despite climbing against the yen. U.S. stocks and bonds rallied on the news. Emerging markets and their currencies soared. Commodity-linked currencies jumped, while the Swiss franc, sterling and the euro sprang to their highest levels of the day against the dollar. The Fed's 0.25-percentage-point increase of its key lending rate to 5 from 4.75 was expected. But its adoption of a neutral bias wasn't -- at least not in currency markets. Thus the dollar, positioned for the rewards it would reap from an interest-rate differential widened by a series of rate hikes, was sold off against most currencies. Against the yen, however, the dollar was playing by a different set of rules.
Optimism again ruled the stock market, driving two major indexes to records for a second day, even as gloom infected the bond market. A report of unexpected manufacturing strength reawakened inflation worries among bond traders, who took back some of Wednesday's gains and pushed the benchmark 30-year bond's yield back above the 6 level. But stock investors preferred to focus for a second day on the Federal Reserve's apparent reluctance to raise interest rates further this summer, and they sent stocks ahead for a fifth consecutive day. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set records again. Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 95.62 points, or 0.87, to 11066.42, just 40.77 points, or 0.37, short of its May 13 record close of 11107.19. There was some money that was waiting on the sidelines, and had to get into the market once the Fed announcement came out on Wednesday, said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard A. Rosenblatt. The Fed raised its target interest rate by a quarter-point but said it is neutral for the future, no longer leaning toward rate increases.
The markets rose to record highs today in a broad-based rally fueled by a positive jobs report and a predictable Federal Reserve. The buying spree touched companies of every size in virtually ever sector. The three leading barometers -- the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite -- all posted new highs. Analysts cited two main reasons for the market's best week since October a government report this morning showing the nation gained more jobs than predicted, and continuing relief that the Fed did nothing more than expected when it raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points Wednesday. There was Fed euphoria today, said David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. They did what everybody expected them to do. So everybody thought they must be smart, we must be smart. Led by American Express, the Dow Jones industrials rose for a sixth consecutive day, gaining 72.82, or 0.7 percent. It closed at 11,139.24 -- its first record since May. The blue-chip barometer added its biggest weekly point gain, rising 586 points, or 5.3 percent.
The nation's economic boom continues to produce jobs for some groups, such as minorities and persons with limited education, who have had far more trouble finding them in the past, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The overall U.S. jobless rate inched up to 4.3 percent last month, but the rate among blacks fell to 7.3 percent, the lowest since separate figures for blacks were first published in 1972. Fifteen months ago, in April 1998, the national unemployment rate was the same as last month, 4.3 percent, and the rate for blacks was 9 percent. While the national rate has barely changed during that period, joblessness among blacks has fallen sharply. Among whites, unemployment last month was 3.8 percent, less than half the rate for blacks. But the figure was hardly changed from the 3.7 percent rate of April 1998. A strong demand for workers and the shrinking pool of unemployed workers has led many firms to hire -- and often to train -- people with less education and fewer skills that they had insisted upon in the past. As a result, incomes of workers in the bottom fifth of the income distribution have been rising significantly for the first time in decades after adjusting for inflation.
Is this a ballpark or a brokerage office While fans at Busch Stadium in St. Louis watch the high arc of slugger Mark McGwire's latest home run, they also can see a Bank of America sign out of the corners of their eyes. Or if the hit takes too long to come down, fans can check on how the financial markets fared that day Locally based brokerage firm A.G. Edwards has a sign in left field that displays the close of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. New York Mets officials, meanwhile, must think the stands are packed with day traders and stock-market fanatics who can't get Wall Street off their minds even during the seventh-inning stretch. Why else would TD Waterhouse Group and Reuters Group co-sponsor not one, but two, stock-quotation tickers in the outfield at Shea Stadium Beer and food companies have long promoted their brands by plastering signs on the walls of sports stadiums and arenas. Now banks, brokerage firms and insurance agencies are getting into the game as the explosion in online investing has expanded the audience for Wall Street's pitch. The Mets, who play less than an hour from Wall Street, depending on traffic, recognize that.
Washington's just-ended program to retrain displaced workers has received a so-so report card from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee. The eight-year-old program, which gave extra unemployment-insurance payments to laid-off timber and other displaced workers who enrolled in job-retraining courses, had some success, but the success has been mixed, the committee's report said. The report didn't voice an opinion on whether the Legislature should have continued the program, in which the state paid about 150 million in benefits to some 14,000 laid-off workers enrolled over the years. Lawmakers didn't get around to voting on the question during the 1999 session because they -- and business and union interests -- couldn't resolve their differences over a proposal to keep the program going and expand it to ex-aerospace employees. But the report did suggest that if it had to expire, now was a good time. Given the state's improved employment picture, it said, ending the program now would not have the same potential for an adverse effect as it would have some years ago. According to the report, while most participants did start new careers after finishing their schooling, many landed jobs paying less than what they earned before they were laid off. Those who took the highest concentrations of technically oriented classes, from health and trade courses to science and math classes, ended up earning the highest salaries among the participants. The study also found that in many cases the extension of unemployment payments to workers, and not retraining classes, contributed to higher income.
Yahoo Inc. soundly beat Wall Street expectations for the second quarter, surpassing even unofficial whisper estimates for results and more than doubling its revenue from a year ago. The Santa Clara, Calif., company, one of the top destinations on the Internet, recorded a net loss of 15.1 million, or seven cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of 14.2 million, or eight cents a share, in the year-ago period. Both quarters include merger-related charges. Without the charges, Yahoo earned 28.3 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with year-earlier operating profit of 1.5 million, or one cent a share. The analysts' consensus had been eight cents a share, according to First Call Corp., while some unofficial estimates had recently crept up to nine or 10 cents. Worries that Yahoo wouldn't meet those whisper numbers had caused its stock to slump earlier this week. It closed yesterday down 8.0625 to 167.0625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, but rebounded to 171 in after-hours trading following the announcement, according to Instinet Inc. Yahoo reported continued growth in traffic to its popular Web portal and index site, as well solid operating margins. Revenue swelled to 115.2 million from 44.9 million a year ago, and above analysts' estimates of about 103 million.
NEW YORK -- While many traders speculate on earnings reports, hedge-fund manager Kyle Rosen waits for the Consumer Price Index report. By today's opening bell, he will know how to adjust his short strangles in the Standard & Poor's 500 options to best capitalize on the stock market's reaction to the inflation report. I think that could set the tone, at least for a few days. We seem to be locked in this temporary equilibrium, and the CPI could determine which way we move, Mr. Rosen, president of Rosen Capital Management, said. The market could break out of its trading range if the CPI report meets expectations, but it also could remain range bound between 1385 and 1407 on the S&P 500 if the number is out of line, Mr. Rosen said. A short strangle -- selling a call with a high strike price and selling a put with a low strike price -- gives Mr. Rosen the flexibility to quickly respond to the market.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board approved a special loan facility to ease any liquidity pressures on banks that arise at the end of this year. But the board denied bankers' requests to lower the interest rate to be charged on the loans. The board voted unanimously to create a Century Date Change Special Liquidity Facility, which will let banks borrow funds at a rate 1.5 percentage points above the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which is 5. The program will be available from Oct. 1, 1999, through April 7, 2000, one month longer than originally proposed. Some banks anticipate great demand for cash toward the year's end because of the Year 2000 computer problem, which is expected to render some software unable to differentiate between 2000 and 1900. Recognizing the uncertainty people have about the consequences of the date change on banks' computers, the Fed has promised to have extra cash on hand to avoid potential disruptions. When there are strange distributions or unusual distributions of reserves, banks under pressure that ordinarily wouldn't be under pressure, this will be there to help them out, a Fed official told reporters. By ensuring the ready availability of funds, the facility should enable depositories and their customers to enter into agreements to meet possible credit needs with greater confidence, the Fed said in a memorandum. The facility also should help to damp any tendency for money markets to tighten owing to inevitable difficulties . . . in gauging the overall supply and demand for reserves each day.
Cincinnati Bell Inc. agreed to buy IXC Communications Inc. in a deal valued at 2.2 billion, plus the assumption of about 1 billion in debt. The move will enable the company to expand its Cincinnati phone empire to include business services nationwide. Wall Street responded to the deal by sending Cincinnati Bell down 3.75, or 16, to 19.8125 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading shares of IXC rose 3.50, or 9.7, to 39.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. IXC, an Austin, Texas, long-distance company, is building a nationwide fiber-optic network amid competition from rivals such as Qwest Communications International Inc. But it has so far failed to inspire investor enthusiasm. IXC brought in a chief executive and chief financial officer and is overhauling its strategy in the business-services market. Cincinnati Bell said it is gaining an asset that has the potential to become a big profit center. We see this as a tremendous marriage, said Richard Ellenberger, president and CEO.
Barely three weeks into the second half of the year, economists and others are calling attention to the inevitable The area's economy is beginning to show signs of slowing. One need not be an economist, however, to conclude at some point that the region's economy can't possibly sustain the high level of growth that we've seen in recent years. That's not to say, however, that slower growth will lead to a prolonged slump. It merely means the area's economy is slowly slackening, Stephen S. Fuller, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, told The Washington Post recently. Job growth, generally regarded locally as the bellwether of the area's booming economy, remains at an all-time high. Employment growth has nonetheless tapered off recently, recording a net increase of 13,100 in February and a gain of only 6,700 in April. Meanwhile, the area's unemployment rate edged up slightly in May, rising to 2.6 percent, from 2.3 percent in April, according to the most recent figures compiled by the D.C. Department of Employment Services.
Blue-chip stocks extended their losses today as the renewed threat of higher interest rates convinced investors that the strong corporate earnings of the second quarter might be in jeopardy. After dropping as much as 100 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 58.26 points lower, at 10,910.96. For the week, the Dow lost 298.88 points, or 2.7 percent. Broader stock indicators were mixed, as the Nasdaq composite index, which had fallen steeply earlier this week, managed a last- minute gain of 7.96, closing at 2692.40. For the week, the Nasdaq lost 6.1 percent of its value. Banks and brokerages led the Dow lower today, as Thursday's remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan continued to worry Wall Street. Greenspan told Congress that while 1999 has been an exceptional year for the U.S. economy, the central bank would act promptly and forcefully by raising interest rates at the first hint of inflation pressures.
Q I work at a federal agency. We have a nondiscrimination policy against homosexual people. Most people don't have a problem with this. But a question has come up about a couple who have a special relationship and who have moved back and forth around the country together. Recently, one of the couple was promoted, and she selected the other as her employee, which was a promotion. That has left management in a quandary about the situation. Morale has declined rapidly as other employees feel favoritism has occurred. Married couples who are heterosexual or other workers with a familial relationship are not allowed to enter into this supervisor-employee relationship. It doesn't seem fair that it is permitted with this relationship. A There is widespread consensus that romantic relationships between bosses and subordinates aren't good business practice because, as in this case, they can stir allegations of favoritism, hurt morale and productivity, and even lead to sexual harassment lawsuits if they later go awry. An American Management Association survey in 1994 found that three-quarters of corporate personnel officials said they disapproved of relationships between higher- ranking and lower-ranking employees. But because companies are cautious about treading into the area of personal relationships, only about 6 percent of the firms had policies banning them. The rules are more clear-cut with married couples. In the federal government, there are specific nepotism rules that forbid public officials from hiring, promoting or even offering special training opportunities to a wide array of legal relations, including spouses, fathers, mothers, children, cousins, in-laws and step-family members, according to the Office of Personnel Management, the government agency that oversees personnel matters for many branches of the government. But these rules do not apply to gay people, who cannot legally marry. Consequently, the OPM does not have any rules governing supervisors and subordinates in homosexual relationships, according to an OPM spokesman, who said he also believed it would be an awkward issue to raise at work without appearing to pry into people's personal lives. The OPM is not unusual in not having rules addressing this issue, said Sue Meisinger, chief operating officer and executive vice president of the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks fell sharply, although both groups ended the day above their intraday lows. Stocks pushed lower at the opening following news that the second-quarter employment-cost index rose substantially more than it had in the first quarter, and by more than analysts had been expecting. The jump in employment costs, which often is seen as the first stage of an increase in overall inflation, has increased concerns that the Federal Reserve may see the need to raise interest rates again at its late-August policy meeting. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 5.03, or 1.13, to 441.58, having been down as much as 6.81, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 2640.01, tumbled 65.83, or 2.43, after posting an intraday loss of 78.04. The increased potential for higher rates took its toll on the small-cap and Nasdaq markets' two important sectors, technology and financial services. Internet telephony services company Net2Phone was the star among the day's IPOs, putting in a 77 first-day increase despite the market's jitters. The Hackensack, N.J., firm closed at 26 916 on Nasdaq, up from its offering price of 15 a share.
Economic growth slowed significantly in the second quarter while wages increased at the fastest pace since the early 1990s, the government reported yesterday. The news led to a sell-off on Wall Street as investors feared the Federal Reserve was more likely to raise interest rates again. At first glance, the slowing in the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product from its 4.3 percent clip in the first three months to 2.3 percent in the spring appeared to be a development that would satisfy Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has been counting on a chilling of the economy to forestall the need for any further increases in interest rates. But financial markets passed over that possibility and instead focused on a 1.1 percent increase in the employment cost index ECI, a broad measure of wages and benefits. The index rose at a rate greater than the 0.8 percent analysts had expected--and raised the specter of inflationary pressures increasing in an economy that already is experiencing the tightest labor market in decades. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points, to 10,791.29, as investors worried that the markets' benign environment of strong economic growth and weak inflation was undergoing a sea change. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index slumped 65.83, to 2640.01, and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 24.37, to 1341.03. The bond market also soured on the news, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling 7.81 per 1,000 in face value and the yield rising to 6.07 percent, from 6.00 percent on Wednesday.
The TV images were searingly familiar. Terror-stricken people scrambling to safety. Heavily armed police officers hustling to the scene. Covered bodies being loaded into ambulances. The killing of 12 people by a gunman in Atlanta on Thursday brought back echoes of Columbine High School in April. In several important ways, the two events were similar--in the means and method of attack, in their senselessness and amount of carnage. But where Columbine lingered in the national consciousness for many days, the Atlanta killings were struggling for media attention yesterday, less than 24 hours after the first reports broke. All three national cable news networks carried live coverage of a news conference by Atlanta's police chief all three later aired tapes of the initial 911 calls. But by 2 p.m. yesterday, Fox News Channel was busy analyzing a Congressional tax-cut proposal and MSNBC was summing up the action on the bond market. Despite the proximity of the news to its headquarters, Atlanta-based CNN slipped in reports on the stock market and President Clinton as well. The broadcast networks never turned away from soap operas. Jerry Springer was not preempted. To news analysts and news decision-makers, the relative indifference to Atlanta boils down to two key factors the victims and the setting.
Corporate earnings have come roaring back so fast that it would seem the business environment can't get much betteryet some signs suggest profits won't weaken anytime soon. Second-quarter earnings of major U.S. companies blew past analysts' estimates. Setting aside the effect of cable-TV provider MediaOne Group's extraordinary gain last year of about 24.5 billion, income at the 654 companies that make up the U.S. part of the Dow Jones Global Indexes rose 37 in the second quarter from a year earlier. MediaOne's gain, from its separation from U S West, skews the year-to-year comparison including the gain, net income was up 5. Other one-time events, such as writeoffs and gains from the sale of affiliates, and easy comparisons against year-earlier results weakened by restructuring charges boosted the companies' net income. But even operating income, which excludes such items, rose 15 from the second quarter of last year, according to calculations done by First CallThomson Financial for The Wall Street Journal. In the 1999 first quarter, net income was down 6, while operating income rose 9.6. Analysts who wondered early this year if the rebound in first-quarter operating profits was a fluke now know for sure that it wasn't business is better for a broad swath of corporate America. The bottom line is that business is good and we expect it to continue for a while, says Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, which tracks corporate earnings. We're in a period of accelerating earnings growth that will peak out in the third quarter, but we still expect earnings to stay strong.
NEW YORK -- A big push from Union Carbide couldn't compensate for sharp losses by technology and growth stocks, as market indicators dropped again. Shares of a host of Internet stocks paced the decline for a second straight session. DoubleClick fell 6 1316 to 67 1116, Yahoo eased 4 38 to 121, eBay decreased 8 58 to 75 34 and Excite At Home shed 2 38 to 41, all on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Internet Index, which topped out in mid April, fell 3.3. The sector barometer has retreated 30 from its record. Even the deans of the sector, such as America Online, which declined 1 38 to 87 716, and CMGI Nasdaq, which lost 5 78 to 76, weren't immune to the selling, as investors showed unexpected fortitude despite some relatively bargain-basement prices coming into the session. As on Tuesday, the loss leaders included smaller, more-speculative names in the technology sector, while the sell-off again spared the blue-chip names. Hewlett-Packard gained 1 34 to 110 14. Intel Nasdaq, which traded at a 52-week high, finished with a loss of just 116 at 72 1316.
WASHINGTON -- The July employment report did little to ease concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to further reduce inflationary pressures. While July unemployment remained steady at 4.3, hourly wages rose faster than at any time since January, and the economy added a higher-than-expected 310,000 nonfarm jobs. The report appears to bolster the view of those Fed officials who are advocating higher rates -- perhaps another quarter percentage point -- when the policy committee meets Aug. 24. For some Fed watchers, the jump in nonfarm jobs was the most troubling aspect of the report. Most economists had predicted gains in the range of 200,000 to 230,000 new jobs, well below the actual figure. Financial markets flinched at the news. After rising slightly in early morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day at 10714.03, down 79.79. The bond market, which is much more sensitive to inflationary fears, reacted more severely. The benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 2032 to 87 1532, pushing the yield to 6.168, its highest level since November 1997. Financial futures traders, however, substantially increased their bets that the Fed would raise rates. Based on the movement of futures contracts as of midday, they were betting with 86 certainty that a rate increase would occur, up from 64 late Thursday.
NEW YORK -- It was a nerve-racking week to be a technology-stock investor, and as usual much of the pain was felt in the small-stock and Nasdaq markets. Last week, amid a flurry of selling in Internet-related stocks, and rare declines for initial public offerings of Web names, the Russell 2000 small-stock index fell 3.8 and the Nasdaq Composite Index -- dominated by large tech stocks -- dropped 3.4. In contrast, most other market measures had more-moderate declines, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.55 for the week. The Nasdaq composite now has fallen 11 from its July 16 record close. In the same period, the Russell 2000 has dropped 8, leaving it 12.9 below its April 21, 1998 record high. On Friday, technology stocks, which like the small-cap and Nasdaq markets have been under steady selling pressure the past few weeks, pushed moderately lower. The small-cap market was weighed down by the weakness of financial-services stocks, which make up the largest industry group in the Russell 2000 index, and which are particularly sensitive to rising interest rates. The Nasdaq nonbank financial index fell 2.7. After Friday's modest declines, the Russell 2000 stands at 428.04, and the Nasdaq composite at 2547.97.
The U.S. economy is still growing strongly with labor shortages reported nationwide, the Federal Reserve said yesterday in a report that highlighted concerns that the economy may be growing too rapidly. The Fed's latest survey of economic conditions around the country, compiled from reports from its 12 regional banks, found only scattered signs of mounting wage pressures and little evidence of rising inflation in general. Widespread labor shortages persist in virtually every district, but there have been only scattered reports of acceleration in wages, the Fed survey said. There are some reports of accelerating prices-- largely related to home construction--but there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price inflation. The Fed survey, known as the beige book for the color of its cover, will be used by Fed policymakers when they next meet Aug. 24 to review interest-rate policies. There has been a growing concern in financial markets that the central bank will boost interest rates for the second time this year because of growing fears that inflation will take off if economic growth does not slow.
WASHINGTON -- Just a few months ago, American policy makers fretted that the world economy was flying on a single engine, the turbo-charged U.S. Now, they see signs that Europe and Japan and other parts of Asia may finally be revving up again. The brighter prospects for global growth are moving financial markets. The dollar has fallen against the yen as well as the euro, as investors shift their capital to increasingly attractive investment opportunities outside the U.S. Yesterday, the dollar dropped to its lowest level against the yen in seven months, in part because of a fresh batch of positive economic news out of Tokyo. President Clinton said in a recent television interview that he wasn't particularly alarmed by the dollar's modest decline. He said that his administration still supports a strong dollar. But he also suggested that the currency's recent softness is a price worth paying for the benefits of more-balanced world growth. A stronger global economy provides a stronger market for our exports, and reduces pressures on other countries to dump surplus products into our markets, says Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. More broadly, Mr. Summers says that recovery abroad means a more stable and harmonious global economy, in which disruptive shocks to financial systems are less likely. Yet just as foreign turmoil produced both winners and losers in the U.S. during the past two years, a rebound overseas would cause a new round of gain and pain at home.
A piece of the New York Stock Exchange went public yesterday the bulls didn't stampede. In fact, investors looking to the possible IPO of the entire Big Board itself hope it will make a bigger splash than yesterday's debut by LaBranche & Co., one of the pre-eminent Big Board floor-trading firms-so-called specialists -- and the first to complete an initial public stock offering. LaBranche, the third-largest specialist firm, offered its shares Wednesday night at 14 each, below the expected price range of 15 to 17. The company had filed 11.5 million shares, but sold just 10.5 million. Not only is LaBranche the specialist firm in charge of trading such blue chips as AT&T and Exxon, it is a firm that is an integral part of the world's most-famous trading floor. Specialists stand on the exchange's floor and match buyers and sellers of particular stocks and put up their own capital when necessary to ensure smooth trading. But the small-capitalization LaBranche IPO finished its first day of Big Board trading yesterday up just 3.5 over the offering price at 14.50 -- not exactly a big splash in an era of skyrocketing dot-com issues.
The hood of the school bus is cracked open like a giant yellow clamshell, and Alysia Saddler leans in with a pointer and ticks through the checklist. This is the radiator cap. It can't be cracked or leaking or hot. The sight glass--when there's enough coolant, it's green. Hoses aren't supposed to have bubbles. There's the air compressor, the power steering is secure, the air lines, the steering shaft . . . The suspension, the spring hangers, the leaves, clamp, the U bolt is in the proper position, the drag link, the tie rod . . .  It's an impressive display from a 24-year-old who weeks ago, before starting Howard County's school bus driver training, could barely identify the dipstick under a car's hood. Back then she was just a tow-truck dispatcher from Catonsville now she's a commodity as rare as a moon rock. With the opening bells of schools ready to sound, officials are struggling to get enough bus drivers behind the wheel. During prosperous times--Washington area unemployment was only 2.9 percent in June--any job is tough to fill. But it's hardest to get people to take a job that rarely guarantees full-time hours and only sometimes carries benefits. Add to that the perception that children's behavior and traffic have degenerated, and the entire nation is facing a driver shortage.
NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates gave high-growth technology issues reason to slip out from under the cloud of valuation pressures but did take a little steam out of some cyclical issues. Shares of several blue-chip names in the technology sector posted sharp gains by the close. Microsoft added 5 34 to 92 316 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Gateway gained 3 516 to 97, and EMC rose 2 to 62 12. Shares of Micron Technology, trying to cement its status as a new entrant in the inner circle of blue-chip names, shot up 4 1516 to 68 1516. A few rifts developed in the sector, as International Business Machines fell 2 716 to 122, and the best Intel Nasdaq could do turned out to be a 316 gain to 83 18, though it set a 52-week high intraday. Overall, semiconductor stocks played a leadership role for the broader technology group. Investors think that with further rate hikes off the table, it makes high PE price-to-earnings ratio stocks more attractive, said Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The news has been better for tech stocks than for industrials. In fact, those industrials finished with only slight gains, despite some wilder swings in market averages throughout the day.
Stocks finally managed a mild recovery after four weak days, but bonds and the dollar kept falling. After declining every trading day since hitting a record on Aug. 25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally rose 108.60 points, or 1.00, to 10937.88. That leaves the industrials still 3.43 short of last week's 11326.04 record, although up 19.13 for 1999. Other stock indexes also managed small advances. But the dollar fell to yet another low since Jan. 11 in late New York trading. Bond and stock investors went in opposite directions. Bond investors worried that August payroll and unemployment data due tomorrow could signal a strong economy, pushing the Federal Reserve toward raising interest-rate guidelines again next month. Stock investors bet that interest-rate boosts are about done with, Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said. The stock gains were a precelebration of Friday's news, he said, adding people are expecting that the payroll number will be weaker than forecast. They think that the markets will see a better interest-rate environment as we go into the fourth quarter.
Corrections & Amplifications ANNTAYLOR STORES Corp. reported total sales of 66.1 million for the four weeks ended Aug. 28, up 21.4 from a year earlier. Year-to-date sales rose 21.1 to 581.2 million. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 9 in August and 12 for the year to date. Based on information provided by the company, a table accompanying Friday's Industry Focus gave year-earlier data. WSJ Sept. 7, 1999 Retailers rang up modest gains in sales for August, but some analysts cautioned that the pace could signal the beginning of a slowdown in consumer spending. Overall, retailers posted respectable gains for the month, led by strength from the discount sector. But several retailers, including Sears, Roebuck & Co. and J.C. Penney Co., reported disappointing results. And the most recent gains were milder than retailers have reported for most of this year, even though August is traditionally a month when consumers are expected to spend more money on back-to-school shopping. We've been waiting for a consumer slowdown for four months now, ever since interest rates started climbing back up, said Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. This could be the early sign that that process is under way.
U.S. productivity growth slowed and labor costs rose sharply in the second quarter, sparking new fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again next month. Productivity at non-farm businesses rose at an annual rate of 0.6 percent and labor costs rose at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the April-June period, according to revised estimates released yesterday by the Labor Department. The department earlier had estimated the productivity growth rate at 1.3 percent. Stock and bond prices fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average initially dropping more than 200 points. The Dow closed down 94.67 points to end at 10,843.21. Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds at yesterday's close rose to 6.13 percent, from 6.08 percent. Strong productivity growth helps keep inflation low by allowing employers to boost wages and salaries without necessarily raising the prices paid by their customers. The second-quarter productivity number was down considerably from the 3.6 percent rate in the first quarter. Investors apparently were concerned that faltering productivity growth could prompt the Fed to raise short-term rates, as it did at the end of June and again last month, to make sure inflation stays under control.
If you hold mutual funds that are allowed to invest in all kinds of stocks, what Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve decide to do this year and beyond should make little difference to your investment decisions. As a holder of a broad-based fund, you are doing more than just buying a bunch of companies You also are investing in the brains of your fund manager. Part of the service you should expect is that your manager is able to anticipate changes in interest rates, or else to react to changes very quickly. But if you invest in individual stocks or sector-based mutual funds, interest rates matter greatly, the same way they do to the manager of a growth or general-performance fund. A good manager would dump certain stocks and embrace others if assumptions about future inflation changed. All stocks do not react the same way to higher interest rates, and no major market features more differentiated behavior among stocks than the United States. If interest rates are set to keep rising, it pays to have a plan of action. To see why rates matter so much to certain kinds of companies, imagine your household has little or no debt at all. You pay rent on an apartment every month, pay off your credit card in full regularly and take the bus to work. You are saving for some day in the future when you will buy a car or a house, maybe five or eight years down the road. How do interest rates affect you Probably only inasmuch as higher rates get you a higher return on your savings account. But if you had a mortgage and car payments tied to movable interest rates, then a major increase in rates would actually hurt you, maybe quite badly, as your mortgage payments increased. The same goes for companies. Higher interest rates can kill businesses that are heavily leveraged have a lot of debt, or those that invest heavily in bonds. Insurance companies hold piles of bonds, for instance, because they have so much premium money to invest. Because bond prices move in the opposite direction to rates, higher rates make the insurance company's bonds worth less.
As America observes the century's last Labor Day, workers are reaping the benefits of the best economy in modern history. But whether the nation's work force continues to prosper and post gains in income and financial security will depend largely on some critical decisions that Congress and the president will make in the coming months. We're in an economic expansion that just won't quit. At 4.3 percent, our unemployment rate is the lowest since 1970, and the lowest of any major country. More than 64 percent of the adult population is working today -- more than ever before in our history. Inflation remains at an insignificant level. Real wages have increased nearly 5 percent in just the past two years. Home ownership is at an all-time high. Since 1990, household financial assets have doubled, and since 1995, the increase in household financial assets for each year was equivalent to nearly one-half of disposable after-tax income for all households. Millions of Americans own stock directly, and millions more own stock indirectly through pension funds. That's a clear sign that Main Street and Wall Street are becoming one and the same. While politicians are quick to take credit for the booming economy, most of the credit belongs to American companies and their employees -- especially the millions of small businesses and self- employed entrepreneurs who take most of the risk, spur most of the innovations and create most of the new jobs in our country. Yet while government may not have created the current expansion, it will have a profound impact on whether prosperity continues and whether on Labor Day in the year 2000 working families are still moving forward or are in a period of decline.
NEW YORK -- As bond investors return from the holiday, they still have memories of Friday's pleasant kickoff, when bonds went through the roof as investors cheered upbeat economic news. But some analysts say the rejoicing may be out of place, because the jury is still out on the Fed's next move. The price spike on Friday, the last trading day before today, was triggered by bond-friendly employment news, which eased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The Labor Department reported that 124,000 nonfarm employees were added to the nation's payrolls in August, a little less than half of what Wall Street had been expecting. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2 from 4.3 in August. Meanwhile, average hourly wages increased just 0.2, comforting investors worried that rising wages will lead to higher inflation. The news sent bond prices climbing. In preholiday trading that ended early, at 2 p.m. EDT Friday, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1732, or 15.313 for a bond with 1,000 face value, to 101 1332. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.014. It was the first gain for Treasurys in seven sessions. Other types of bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities, also rallied.
Blue-chip stocks treaded water yesterday, but the broad market declined on profit-taking in semiconductor stocks and concern over comments by a Fed governor on the outlook for inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crept up 2.21 points to 11036.34 after spending most of the day in negative territory. But Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 6.3 points, or 0.5, to 1344.15, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 28.52 points, or 1, to 2808.74. Dominating the technology scene was a midday reversal in semiconductor stocks led by Intel, which went from up 1 on the day to fall 1.6875 to 85.9375. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 1.7, but it is up 45 from late May. The fact the index, as well as some higher-profile components like Micron Technology and Texas Instruments, were making 52-week or all-time highs triggered alarm among some investors who thought the air was feeling kind of thin, Ciaran O'Kelly, a stock trader at Salomon Smith Barney, said. They decided to take some money off the table. There is speculation Intel will announce that third-quarter earnings are expected to be above current analysts' estimates. If so, it will likely be soon since the company enters its quiet period Monday ahead of reporting earnings Oct. 12. An Intel spokesman declined to comment.
NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York unveiled several moves aimed at ensuring there will be enough funds in the banking and financial systems ahead of year 2000. The initiatives involve the Fed's so-called open-market operations, whereby the Fed adds and subtracts money from the financial system. The moves are aimed at preventing financing shortages if the year-2000 computer bug, or worries about it, causes disruptions at year end. There is concern from some parts of the banking industry that demand for short-term financing will increase sharply as 2000 approaches. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve said it would put 50 billion in extra currency in circulation to cope with possible cash-hoarding by individuals, and announced a special liquidity facility for lending to banks. We want to mitigate the risks, said Peter R. Fisher, executive vice president of the New York Fed and the Federal Open Market Committee's manager for the system open-market account. We face uncertainty as far as possible strains on the system, he said. The steps taken yesterday seemed to reassure members of the bond community and helped the tone in various bond markets yesterday.
Concerned that overnight interest rates could soar late this year because of fears in the financial markets of potential year-end computer glitches, the New York Federal Reserve Bank today announced a series of actions it hopes will help keep rates under control. One step, affecting mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae, could help head off a potential spike in mortgage rates. A number of financial analysts said the changes would help the markets function more smoothly as the new year approaches. Meanwhile, the announcement had an immediate impact on some types of securities that mature in December or January. In one instance, the interest rate on a type of contract committing someone to make money available in December fell by more than a quarter of a percentage point, which underscored the level of apprehension in the market. This is a doozy, said F. Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial-markets research firm. The Fed is pulling out all the stops to both calm market anxieties and provide the . . . tools necessary to allow the money markets to continue to function through the fourth quarter and early 2000. Overnight rates often shoot up at the end of a year as many major banks, brokerages and investment-banking firms seek to improve the look of their balance sheets by shedding even modestly risky assets. This year, with all the concern about potential year-end computer problems, the pressures could be enormous, though no one is sure that will happen.
Consumer borrowing surged in July, mainly reflecting heavy credit- card use, which posted its sharpest increase in two years. Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a 7.9 percent annual rate in July to a seasonally adjusted 1.354 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. All told, consumers borrowed 8.8 billion more in July than during the month before, greater than the 6.3 billion gain many analysts' had expected. Lorcin Engineering, a California-based manufacturer of inexpensive handguns, shut its doors last month, according to people in the gun industry. Lorcin was one of the leading producers of Saturday night specials, and its guns were among those most frequently traced to crimes. Lorcin's operations were highly profitable, but the company's two business partners recently had a falling-out, industry officials said. Lorcin officials could not be reached or did not respond to requests for comment. American Airlines had the most passenger complaints of any major U.S. airline in July, while America West Airlines ranked last in on- time performance, the government said. American placed first for the second month in a row in complaints, with more than five filed for every 100,000 passengers in July, the Department of Transportation said. About 60 percent of America West's flights were on time, ranking it last among the 10 largest carriers. Southwest Airlines performed best in both areas for the second month in a The American Medical Association wants a federal judge to impose an additional condition on Aetna's 1 billion acquisition of Prudential HealthCare to ensure competition in Dallas and Houston. The AMA said it wants the court for five years to keep Aetna from requiring doctors in the two cities who want to join its network to accept customers from all health plans offered by the company. Wholesaler inventories rose in July by 0.9 percent, their fastest pace in 10 months, led by increases in stockpiles of lumber, electrical equipment and furniture, the Commerce Department reported. Wholesaler sales fell 0.2 percent, their first decline since January.
JAPAN INTERVENED Friday to stem the yen's surge against the dollar. The U.S. currency had plunged to a three-year low when traders bid up the yen on news of Japan's strong GDP growth. After Tokyo's action, the dollar touched 110 yen but later receded slightly. Yesterday in New York, the greenback fell as low as 107.55 yen. The U.S. shows no signs it is ready to intervene itself. --- Illinois Tool Works said it agreed to acquire consumer-products maker Premark for 3.4 billion, creating a broad-based manufacturing giant. --- Torfinex, a wire-transfer company linked to the Bank of New York money-laundering probe, appears to have operated illegally in the U.S., funneling millions of dollars out of Russia, law-enforcement officials said.
The yen soared to a three-year high against the U.S. dollar yesterday, after Japan released better-than-expected numbers about its troubled economy. According to overnight reports from Tokyo, Japan's central bank intervened in the market in a effort to halt the rise, out of fear that it would damage Japan's tentative recovery from a decade of economic malaise. The effort appeared to be working--by late morning Friday Tokyo time, it took 109.92 yen to buy a dollar, 1.08 yen more than it had taken there the previous day. A senior U.S. policymaker appeared to signal that the United States was not sufficiently worried about the yen and the resulting decline in the dollar to join in any intervention. William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said, I don't believe the change in the dollar-yen exchange rates has particularly significant implications for the U.S. economy, Reuters reported. In late trading yesterday in New York, it took only 108.06 yen to buy a dollar, about 3 percent less than the previous day.
governor of Texas, Bill Clements, an irascible Republican who was running for reelection to a second term. It was a lousy year to be a Republican, given the national recession, but right up until the weekend before the vote, Tarrance's polls showed his client cruising toward victory. When Election Day came, however, Clements got swamped by a tidal wave of Democratic voters. A few weeks later, Tarrance saw the vanquished governor at a meeting of the Republican Governors' Association and coined a memorable line when asked how their first post-election session went. It was like being Napoleon's intelligence chief after Waterloo, Tarrance said. Tarrance's remarkable candor offers a benchmark as the campaign of 2000 heats up. Over the next 14 months, a small army of pollsters will chart the mood of America and offer insights into the psyches of every imaginable demographic slice of the electorate to candidates hungry for the clues that will turn a close contest into victory. The luckiest among them will end up with the unofficial title of pollster to the president, which will bring fame and no little fortune. But the law of averages says that somewhere along the way, some of these pollsters will get it wrong -- a single poll perhaps, a strategic insight almost certainly, even possibly a whole race, although the odds weigh heavily against that, given the round-the- clock sampling that marks the conclusion of any truly competitive race. You wouldn't guess it from talking to them, however. in the polling business recently to ask what happens when things go wrong. The calls produced few confessional tales of the race that got away or the poll that went awry. As Mark Mellman,a Democratic pollster, put it, More often than not it's a matter of interpretation. The numbers aren't usually wrong. Even though every pollster knows that one poll in five is likely to be outside the margin of error, the bad ones mostly have disappeared into the mists of memory.
NEW YORK -- The aftermarket has been kind to many of August's underachieving new issues. Most of the companies that foundered when they launched their initial public offerings last month have found new life and many market watchers are pointing to this trend as a sign that, when the IPO market returns from its traditional summer slowdown this week, momentum is on its side. We've gotten a little bit of a reprieve from the selloff in August, said Kathy Smith, portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital's IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund in Greenwich, Conn. Investors are still jittery, but they're definitely feeling better about the near term, and that's so important for the small-cap growth sector. This shift in sentiment is seen most clearly in many of the Internet IPOs that had struggled for most of August. Online recruitment company HotJobs.com Inc., for instance, sold 3 million shares at 8 each-below price estimates of 9 to 11and closed at 8 in its first day of trading on Aug. 10, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. The company's shares, though, closed Friday at 26.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mortgage.com Inc. closed below its 8 offering price when it debuted Aug. 11, but now trades at 16.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Even those companies that saw just modest gains in their opening days have had big increases. Homestore.com Inc. closed at 22.75 Aug. 4 after pricing 7 million shares, then barely broke 23 after its first week. The shares closed Friday at 49.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Likewise, Netscout Systems Inc. closed at 13.875, a healthy premium over its 11 offering price, when it debuted Aug. 12. But now the shares stand at 26.625 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The Agriculture Department cut its harvest forecasts to reflect the devastating drought in the Eastern U.S., but consumers won't see much impact in their food bills. Lush conditions in the Midwest mean farmers in the major grain states probably will harvest large enough crops over the next several weeks to keep the nation awash in a price-depressing grain glut. The two-year-old glut, combined with weak exports, has tipped the farm economy into recession. Several economists said they continue to expect U.S. grocery prices to climb only about a moderate 2 this year. Cheap prices of raw materials such as corn are helping food manufacturers offset their rising costs of energy and labor. There is still plenty of everything to go around, said John M. Schnittker, a farm economist in Washington. Based on monthly field surveys, the USDA said it expects farmers to harvest 2.78 billion bushels of soybeans, down 3 from its August forecast but still 1 larger than last year's record harvest.
TIANJIN, China -- Three years ago, Tianjin Optical & Electrical Communication Group typified the thousands of backward state-owned companies that drag on China's economy The electronics manufacturer boasted skilled technicians, but mismanagement had pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy. Motorola Inc. changed that. The U.S. telecommunications company offered to take on Tianjin Optical as a supplier if the company adopted Motorola's quality-control and management practices. Today, Tianjin Optical sells a third of its products to Motorola and ekes out a slim profit. Now, we think we can survive, says Zhang Bingjun, Tianjin Optical's chairman. Motorola's corporate doctoring is but one example of the far larger role in China that foreign businesses play beyond providing jobs and padding the country's tax roll. Since Communist China opened up to overseas investment two decades ago, foreign companies have become an important catalyst in economic reform, introducing modern management as well as technology. Including these collateral benefits, foreign firms and their joint ventures account for as much as a fifth of China's trillion-dollar economy. That help is all the more critical now as China's consumer spending flags and prices fall, threatening to pull the economy into a slump. Every dollar spent by multinationals adds 2.50 to China's economy, estimates Gilbert Choy, head of China research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. When multinational manufacturers buy from Chinese suppliers, those suppliers, in turn, spend money to expand their own production lines, generating business for other local companies. Sourcing by large automotive companies such as General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, have spawned a vast network of auto-parts suppliers.
Your stocks or mutual funds may--or may not--have gained much in value this year. But unless you live in one of a handful of places around the country, you can be certain of this Your home racked up solid appreciation gains in the last 12 months--5.3 percent on average nationwide, and 8 percent to 9 percent in the hottest statewide markets, such as Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado, plus Washington, D.C. And unlike your stock market profits, there's an extra layer of icing on top of your home's appreciation It's tax-free, and it can be readily converted to cash if you need it--which is what growing numbers of American consumers are doing. Two new national statistical studies highlight the continuing, impressive jumps underway in home values, and how owners are turning at least some of that appreciated equity into spendable dollars. The first study, prepared by a federal agency that monitors the housing economy, documents what gleeful homeowners and sellers suspected Inflation in most goods and services may be in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent a year, but home values are jumping at four to five times that pace. According to the latest data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, even three of the four slowest-appreciating markets--Nevada, Pennsylvania and Idaho, with gains in resale value of 3 percent or less--are beating inflation in the overall economy. Hawaii posted a scant 0.1 percent appreciation rate during the last 12 months. Massachusetts continues to lead the nation's resale-value boom, with a 9.3 percent average rate of gain per house in the last year, and nearly a 30 percent increase over the last five years. That's especially impressive given Massachusetts' already high-cost housing stock. If you bought a 300,000 house outside Boston last year, it's probably worth about 327,000 today. If you bought it in 1994, it's probably worth about 386,000. Other relatively pricey home real estate areas are not far behind.
Treasury Secretary Larry Summers may have concluded by now that some guys do have all the luck. His fabled predecessor Robert Rubin seems to have left the cupboard bare. The state of Summers's karma matters. He arguably has one of the four or five most important jobs in the world--along with guys named Clinton, Greenspan and Yeltsin. If the financial gods frown at Larry Summers at some point, they frown at nearly all of us. And they are curling a lip his way right now. A stock market that soared to irrationally exuberant new heights under Rubin has yo-yoed downward under Summers. The strong dollar that helped wring inflation out of the U.S. economy has weakened erratically against the Japanese yen, tearing a hole in international monetary cooperation. And Summers was forced to defend himself in Congress last week against charges that he contributed to the ineffectiveness of U.S. aid to Russia. This sea of troubles arrives as Summers plays symbolic host this week to the annual gathering here of the world's most important central bankers, finance ministers, private banking executives and the other assorted money men who have some connection to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Rubin managed these meetings with his customary aplomb, elegantly turning aside European schemes to weaken U.S. domination of the IMF and, to calm the panicky types, repeating that the world's economic fundamentals were solid.
BOSTON -- With the Big Dig more than halfway done, is it time to start on Big Dig II A five-year, 4 million study nearing completion by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority says yes. The study found that drilling beneath downtown Boston and connecting North and South stations with a 1.1-mile, four-track train tunnel would yield huge transportation benefits and could even pay for itself. Perhaps the most shocking conclusion of the report so far is that the cost of linking Boston's primary train stations has actually gone down since the first study of the project was completed in 1993. The study has the project's price tag at 3.68 billion, which, after adjusting for inflation, is 35 less than the 1993 figure. That's mostly because new electric-diesel locomotives significantly reduce the number of tracks that need to be electrified for the project. Everybody should get down on their knees and pray that it happens, says Bob O'Brien, chairman of a citizens advisory committee that is reviewing the study. For the project to proceed, the full report needs to be published and subjected to comments from the public and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Finally, the project backer -- which could be the MBTA, Amtrak or another entity -- would issue a proposal with specific plans.
For mutual-fund investors, the stock market's move toward evening trading won't push back dinner. Large fund companies surveyed this week say they have no plans to change their practice of pricing mutual funds at the traditional market closing time of 4 p.m. Eastern time to take advantage of extended trade-reporting hours that will begin Monday at the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. And while a few traders at mutual-fund firms may end up staying later to check out stock opportunities in the evening market, longer trading hours probably won't force much more trading at first, either. Of course, if evening trading catches on and attracts a high volume of individuals' trades, mutual-fund firms may find they can't afford to miss out, industry executives say. I keep wondering if this is going to be the party where everyone's invited and no one comes, said Andy Brooks, head of trading for T. Rowe Price Associates, Baltimore. Mr. Brooks plans to keep his trading schedule pretty much the same, doing paperwork in the early evening, not trading, even as stock exchanges are open later. We'll be there, but only if there are opportunities, he said. At some point, we all need time for the market to be closed. Fidelity Investments, the nation's biggest mutual-fund company, is studying the issue of evening trading and is planning to make further determinations once all the exchange plans are known, said a spokesman for the Boston company. But for now, Fidelity intends for the forseeable future to price funds at the normal 4 p.m. closing time.
A jittery Wall Street pummeled stock prices for most of the trading session yesterday before bargain hunters helped pull prices back up toward the close. The Dow Jones industrials lost 27.86 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 10,275.53, but that was far above the intra-day low of about 10,080. Fear is the issue here, an innate insecurity that too much of a good thing has gone on for long, said Michael Farr, president and chief investment officer of Farr, Miller & Washington, a D.C.-based financial-consulting firm. Bellwethers Microsoft and Intel took big hits. The software giant touched an intra-day low of 89-116 but finished at 91-716, a little lower than Monday's close of 92 18. Intel at one point dipped to 75 14 before recovering to finish at 77 12. On Monday it had closed at 78-316. Investors, concerned about another round of interest-rate increases, have been driving stock prices down for the past few weeks. The Federal Reserve's rate-policy-setting committee will meet next week to evaluate the economy, though most Fed watchers believe there is little chance the Fed will raise rates next week.
Quarter's end brought a one-day bounce for stocks and bonds, leaving investors to debate whether they can hope for a more lasting rebound as the year's final quarter begins. Amid heavy buying by large professional investors that wanted to avoid showing unspent cash on their books, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.47 points, or 1.21, to 10336.95, the blue-chip index's biggest gain in almost four weeks. With the latest economic news seeming to militate against a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase, investors also turned more optimistic about the market's future. Most major indexes gained, although technology stocks tended to lag behind. Treasury bonds posted sharp gains. The dollar, which has been regaining ground against the yen in recent days, pulled back a bit. It was end of the quarter, so there was a lot of portfolio rebalancing, said John Peluso, head of block trading at Lehman Brothers. Perhaps more significant, he said, was a rebound by bank and financial stocks that appeared to start before the brunt of the rebalancing process hit. That gave a better tone to the tape and that's what gave legs to the market, Mr. Peluso said. Financial stocks benefited from news that second-quarter economic growth was slower than initially believed and that unemployment claims were up last week. This added credence to the widening view that inflation is under control and that the Federal Reserve may leave interest rates alone at its policy meeting on Tuesday.
Stocks rallied sharply for the first time in nearly two weeks as a government report of slower economic growth raised hopes that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates next week after all. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.47 to close at 10,336.95, the index's second gain in eight sessions. It was also the Dow's biggest point gain since Sept. 3. Broader indicators were higher as well. The Standard & Poor's 500- stock index rose 14.34, to 1282.71, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 15.89, to 2746.16. Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy, weighed down by record trade deficits, saw its growth slow to an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the second quarter, the lowest rate of expansion in four years. The report on the nation's gross domestic product provided some relief for investors who have driven stocks lower over the past week as they pessimistically awaited the Fed's Oct. 5 meeting on interest rates.
The rise of soft money has been the most disturbing trend in campaign finance in the 1990s. The idea that groups and individuals can inject unlimited, unregulated amounts of money allegedly for party building into campaigns for federal office has made a mockery of the post-Watergate reforms enacted in 1974. The fatal flaw of the 1974 law is the capping of individual contributions at 1,000 per person--never adjusted or indexed for inflation. This has made Senate and House incumbents very difficult to beat, and has meant that non-incumbent candidates not personally wealthy or closely connected to the party establishment are finding it increasingly difficult to mount serious campaigns. I believe soft money, whether by corporations, unions, interest groups or individuals, should be prohibited. But to make such a ban work, reformers must accept the simple fact that if we want competitive elections, the ability of candidates to raise large amounts of money from individuals and from fully regulated political action committees is a good thing, not a bad thing. The limit on individual contributions should be raised to 5,000 and indexed against future inflation. The limit on contributions by political action committees should be raised from 5,000 to 10,000 and indexed. I do not favor putting restrictions on issue ads. The American people should have the right to express their opinions under the First Amendment. But encouraging people and groups who care about issues to advance their beliefs by supporting candidates they agree with will go nowhere until campaign contributions can once again be large enough to make a difference in our elections. I am running for president because I want an American democracy that invests in the future of its children by lifting them out of poverty and offering every child--every child--a decent education. I want more Americans to have good health care. I want to heal the racial divide that short-circuits our national potential. I want to be the good steward of a good economy in which working Americans of all incomes can become financially secure. But I know to achieve any of these things, we need a healthy democratic process. A process in which everyone's voice can be heard, where dissent is respected and candidates run on the strength of their ideas--not the weight of their wallets. That is why I advocate comprehensive campaign finance reform, to make our democracy work for people again. In July, I laid out my proposals, which include  Public financing of congressional general elections, with federal funding on a matching basis for small contributions in the primary and overall spending limits.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices rose as investors, betting the Federal Open Market Committee will refrain from raising rates when it meets today, took advantage of beaten-down prices to scoop up Treasurys. Strength in the dollar, and weakness among some key commodities, also helped the market's tone. In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was up 1932, or 5.9375 for a bond with a 1,000 face value, at 100 1432. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.083 from 6.127. Medium-term bonds also rose. Ten-year Treasurys, for example, climbed 832 to yield 5.927. Bonds tumbled on Friday, after the release of stronger-than-expected economic data. But yesterday some investors saw value in Treasurys. The market was a little bit oversold, and while a small minority of people expect rates to be raised today, it's still a minority, said Bill Kirby, Prudential Securities' co-head of government trading.
Asarco's board unanimously recommended that shareholders reject takeover offers from Phelps Dodge and Grupo Mexico, challenging suitors for the copper producer to raise their bids. The directors also authorized management to begin seeking better offers. The offer from Phelps is valued at 1.98 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt, while Grupo Mexico has offered 2.05 billion in cash and assumed debt. The Nasdaq Stock Market unveiled a new electronic display system that it says will give customers access to better prices and make it easier to execute trades quickly. Nasdaq has asked for Securities and Exchange Commission approval of the new system, designed to link all types of alternative trading networks and to make the market more transparent by revealing more orders. It hopes to adopt the new plan in about a year. A Superior Court judge discharged a jury hearing a class-action lawsuit filed by New Jersey consumers allegedly injured by fen-phen, a diet-pill combination made by American Home Products. The move suggested that the judge anticipates a global out-of-court settlement for all fen-phen users--a deal reportedly totaling 4 billion-- though details of a final agreement are still being discussed. The Canadian Auto Workers reached a tentative contract agreement with DaimlerChrysler less than two hours before 13,800 union workers were set to strike. CAW President Buzz Hargrove said the deal was modeled on an agreement the CAW rank-and-file ratified last week with Ford of Canada. A former Kidder, Peabody consultant agreed to pay 140,612 to settle SEC accusations that he and the firm rigged bids connected to a 1993 bond financing for Tampa, federal and state regulators said. The Securities Exchange Commission contended that Michael Cornblum and Kidder used fictitious bids to get the firm hired to help Tampa restructure a municipal-bond escrow account.
The after-hours trading revolution on U.S. stock markets has been delayed yet again. While certain individual investors can already trade stocks through alternative trading systems as late as 8 p.m. EDT -- or even overnight -- the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange will sit out the evening session a little longer, it was announced Friday. Nasdaq said it pushed back the tentative date when it will extend hours for certain stock-quotation distribution systems to Oct. 25 from today. The market said it is working out details of the plan with its participants and with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has yet to approve it. That means a similar plan for NYSE-listed stocks most likely also will be pushed back. Those plans, of course, never did amount to a full-blown extension of hours by the two stock forums. Both the Big Board and Nasdaq, a unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, plan to keep their official closing time at 4 p.m. Eastern time until at least next year. Meanwhile, investors were given some preliminary guidance on Friday as to how after-hours trading on the major U.S. stock markets might look. Three of the four working groups created at a June summit to study the issues of full-blown extended hours by Nasdaq and the Big Board submitted reports containing their recommendations.
With earnings hopes up and interestrate worries on hold, technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to yet another record close, although most other stocks fell. In a session of light Columbus Day trading, the Nasdaq composite, dominated by names such as Intel and Dell Computer, rose 29.38 points, or 1.02, to 2915.95 yesterday. With a sixth consecutive trading day of gains, the Nasdaq composite surpassed its Sept. 10 record close of 2887.06. With its first close ever above 2900, it now is less than 100 points short of 3000, up nearly 33 since Jan. 1. But other major indexes fell slightly, and more stocks declined than advanced on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.58, or 0.01, to 10648.18. The dollar pulled back, while the bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday. Technology bulls prevailed over bears who fear that companies will restrict technology purchases because of possible year-2000 computer glitches, said James M. Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for stocks at Boston mutual-fund group State Street Research. The bulls are buying the stocks for the longer term, Mr. Weiss said, amid optimism about semiconductor demand and about use of technology to boost productivity. The mid-term to long-term fundamentals are just terrific for tech, Mr. Weiss said. Intel and Motorola advanced yesterday amid hopes for their third-quarter earnings, which are to be announced today. But investors appeared cautious about the prospects for earnings from nontechnology companies as the earnings-announcement season kicks off in earnest this week.
Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica, an Italian economics journal. Reprinted with permission. Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset. The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25 under Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon. But in June 1932, during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a maximum level of 60. They remained at or frequently considerably above this level for half a century. The grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to placate the political right. The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second pillar in the platform of supply-side economics. Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented models of global monetarism and macroeconomics.
DAIMLERCHRYSLER AGREED with Aerospatiale Matra to combine their aerospace businesses and create the world's No. 3 aircraft and defense company. The pact between the German and French firms raised concerns at the Pentagon and is likely to intensify the fierce competition between U.S. and European rivals. --- GM posted record third-quarter earnings, beating forecasts and reversing a loss, on strong results in North America. Still, shares eased on worries that momentum might slow and concern about labor costs. --- Retail sales rose just 0.1 in September, cooling after two months of blistering growth. Prices of imported consumer goods rose a sharp 0.3, though, fueling some inflation fears.
Historically, rising interest rates have hurt individuals by making two of their biggest purchases--the automobile and the family home--more expensive. But now, with more individuals owning stock than ever before, rising interest rates are threatening family finances in a third way, one that could ultimately spell an end to the stock market-driven wealth effect fueling the current economic boom. Certainly the country's red-hot housing sector has cooled somewhat, with housing starts, residential construction spending and mortgage loan applications down in recent months. But sales of new and existing homes are still running close to record levels, and auto sales are on track to set a record of more than 17 million this year. But it is in the stock market, where the values of some high- technology companies have been driven to stratospheric levels, where interest rate jitters have been felt most strongly. Yesterday's 267- point sell-off in the Dow Jones industrial average, market strategists said, was largely attributable to fears that interest rates are headed further upward after two summer rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board. The rate increase and the prospect of more rate increases have cooled the equity market, said economist Ray Stone, of Stone and McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. Consumers will probably slow their spending.
Your Sept. 17 article SEC Sweep of 45 Day-Trading Firms highlights the unhealthy and irresponsible speculation taking place in the stock market. In light of the day-trading information already possessed by securities industry regulators, it is time this activity was closely regulated. Unless day trading is checked, this widespread speculative fever may well lead to social, economic and financial disasters. The Federal Reserve should prohibit the extension of margin loans to day traders and limit commercial banks' lending to day-trading brokerage firms. Special higher capital requirements on day-trading brokerage firms should be imposed by the SEC and the NASD. Regulators should mandate that the funds devoted to day trading by any day trader should be restricted by that individual's overall net financial resources. Finally, regulators ought to limit the number of trades by an individual day trader and his brokerage firm on any given day. Moreover, legislation should be passed making it a criminal offense to post information on the Web that is unsubstantiated and unverified. It is irresponsible for regulators not to have begun imposing restrictions on day-trading individuals and firms. They are the new boiler shops of this seven-to-eight-year bull market. E. Magnus Oppenheim President
WASHINGTON -- Though a sharp jump in wholesale prices in September set off fears on Wall Street that long-dormant inflation has awakened, economists said the numbers were artificially boosted by a number of one-time factors, and that widespread evidence of rising prices was still slight. Indeed, the report seems unlikely to spark much panic in one place it matters most, the Federal Reserve, which is charged with keeping inflation in check. In comments over the past few weeks, top officials have been more likely to marvel about the tameness of prices than to express concern about nascent inflation. The sticker shock . . . exaggerates the inflation numbers, economists at Warburg Dillon Reed LLC wrote Friday in a report to clients, adding that the price rises do not represent a significant change in the underlying trend of inflation. The Fed, too, will be able to look past these developments, the Warburg analysts concluded. While the odds of a central-bank interest-rate increase next month may be rising, they said, they are not yet above 50 in our opinion. The numbers in the Labor Department's producer-price report for September were, indeed, stunning. The index for finished goods soared by 1.1, seasonally adjusted, the biggest monthly increase in nine years. That followed a large 0.5 jump in August, an especially terrible back-to-back performance for a price gauge that has been flat or negative for much of the past two years. Even stripping out the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core index jumped by a hefty 0.8. The stock-market reaction was equally dramatic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.90, or 2.6, to 10019.71, and briefly dipped below 10000 for the first time since April. Investor inflation jitters were aggravated by comments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan the night before warning investors and lenders against excessive confidence in the market's lofty levels.
Somehow we doubt too many money managers or even day-traders are heavily into sky-diving. You jump out of an airplane and let your body go into a downward free-fall, trusting yourself to pull the parachute cord at the right time. Everyone who does it says it's fun. But your body is one thing, your net worth something else. And with the market off 5.92 last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now they're worried it's too late, that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall. It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S. economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year. Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk of a downturn during the election campaign If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S. economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, I plan to stay within the spending caps. That's a Beltway thing it's not an economic strategy. A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant prices have been blipping upward. The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices. They're helped by a number of factors, such as the participation of Mexico. But OPEC's success can also be read as a sign of accommodative monetary policies.
Excerpts from the first rough draft of history as reported in The Washington Post on this date in the 20th century. The stock market crash of Black Monday, 1987, was in many ways the nation's gravest financial crisis since the Great Depression. But the Federal Reserve's decisive moves to pump money into the banking system and cut interest rates averted a recession. In fact, the stock market soon recovered and the economy kept growing. An excerpt from the Post of Oct. 20, 1987 The stock market was devastated by the worst one-day collapse in history yesterday in a pandemonium of panic selling that shattered all records and swamped stock exchanges around the country and overseas. The best-known market barometer -- the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks -- plummeted 508 points, five times the previous record set last Friday. The Dow closed at 1738, dropping 22.6 percent, or nearly double the 12.8 percent plunge of Oct. 28, 1929, the crash that began the Great Depression. More than 604 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 239 million on the American and over-the-counter markets, shattering previous records.
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's strong profit stirred enthusiasm for technology stocks. Microsoft Nasdaq jumped 5 1516 to 92 14 after the software company issued fiscal first-quarter earnings late Tuesday that topped analysts' forecasts. Salomon Smith Barney, praising what it called a pristine profit statement, bumped up its fiscal 2000 profit estimate for the company. They played off those Microsoft numbers from the opening bell, and we've seen some good follow-through in the technology sector, said John Manahan, head of trading at Brown Brothers Harriman. Gateway rose 5 18 to 52, Hewlett-Packard gained 2 1316 to 76 916, and Apple Computer climbed 6 58 to 75 18 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Even Dell Computer moved higher, gaining 1 12 to 40 on Nasdaq. Dell had stirred some profit worries for the technology sector when it warned earlier this week its results would be hurt by rising prices for memory products. Strong profit performances from other technology issues contributed to the optimism evident in the session. Computer Associates gained 3 34 to 58 14 after its fiscal second-quarter profit, released late Tuesday, proved a penny a share better than analysts anticipated.
BUENOS AIRES -- Fernando de la Rua is favored to win Argentina's presidential race Sunday, and his choice for the Finance Ministry will be an anxiously awaited signal on the course of the country's economic policy. Argentina's finance minister is second in importance to the president. The country doesn't have enough savings to finance its own growth or debt load, so the finance minister must constantly bolster the confidence of international investors. One of the first challenges faced by the new economic team will be the financing of about 16 billion in Argentine debt in global markets next year. The second challenge is to regain momentum on economic reforms. The Argentine peso is fixed to the U.S. dollar, and without additional policies that enhance productivity or lower costs, Argentine companies risk losing competitiveness. Mr. De la Rua's top pick for the Finance Ministry post appears to be 53-year-old Jose Luis Machinea, who heads a center-left think tank in Argentina. Mr. Machinea has a doctorate in economics from the University of Minnesota, and his peers say he is a smart economist steeped in economic theory. Nevertheless, he is overshadowed by Argentina's instability during the late 1980s when he was central bank president. He left that post in March 1989, and shortly thereafter, following a failed stabilization plan, Argentine inflation spiraled out of control. Mr. Machinea doesn't have the unqualified support of Argentine businessmen or international investors, but he is working to gain their confidence. There are concerns about whether his center-left tendencies might translate into an acceptance of mild forms of protectionism or subsidies, but few doubt his macroeconomic orthodoxy. He wouldn't generate applause, says Aldo Abram, general-director of Exante, an economic consulting firm here, but it wouldn't worry me a bit if he was minister.
WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes fell by 2.1 in September amid rising interest rates, continuing a slide that may indicate the beginning of a slowdown in the domestic economy. Although the annual pace of 5.13 million units, seasonally adjusted, is relatively high by historical standards -- and is up 3.4 from September 1998 -- it is down sharply from June's record rate of 5.63 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. It was the third consecutive decline. The number is down just a little bit, but we're still on pace for a very strong year, said Fred Flick, vice president of economic research for the NAR. Economists attribute the decline to the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increases and argue that it may help show policy makers that the economy can cool enough without a further rate increase when officials meet on Nov. 16. The Fed has already raised rates twice this year-in June and in Augustand economists are trying to figure out whether those moves are working by slowing growth down and, if so, by how much. Economists say it takes months, or sometimes well over a year, for the full impact of a Fed boost to work its way through the economy. But an early reading of whether the policy is having an impact comes from the most interest-sensitive sectors, notably housing and construction.
Stocks closed mostly lower today as revived fears of rising interest rates distracted investors from the latest good news about corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.32 points to close at 10,349.93, having recovered from a loss of as much as 155 points. Broader stock indicators contained their slide. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.02, to 1293.63, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.57, to 2815.95. Stocks fell after bond yields rose early in the day. Analysts said bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, were hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising inflation. That warning sounded familiar to U.S. investors, who fear the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since October 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of the fixed returns available on bonds.
LOS ANGELES -- Over the past three years, Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. has worked hard to develop a marketing-driven approach to home building that it says will insulate it from the industry's notorious cycles. But investors, so far, aren't convinced. The big home builder last month posted its 17th consecutive quarterly earnings report that topped or matched analysts' expectations. Yet its stock sells for just seven times earnings that are expected to increase by 52 to 145 million, or 3.02 a diluted share, for the fiscal year ending next month. The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 17.8125, up 6.25 cents and near a 52week low. Industry-wide, earnings multiples are exceptionally low by historical standards, Merrill Lynch analyst Robert F. Curran says, probably among the lowest ever. The reason fears that another interest-rate increase is imminent, in a year when rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have already risen nearly a percentage point. Wall Street also frets about spot labor shortages and increasing land and construction-materials costs. Bruce Karatz, Kaufman & Broad's chief executive, finds this sentiment exasperating. The market is saying 'the end is near,' and clearly doesn't give Kaufman & Broad Homes credit for changing its business model and mitigating cyclical risk, he complains.
It isn't unusual for a takeover lawyer to get attention for his role in a corporate drama. But a leasing lawyer Meet Jonathan Mechanic, the 47-year-old, bushy-moustached head of real estate for Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in Manhattan. He employs a publicist, socializes relentlessly, and instills drama into the dusty world of landlord and tenant law by turning every negotiation into a fight. I want a tough lease. I want to win every right that can go the client's way, he says. Though rivals deplore his tactics, the 500-an-hour lawyer has collected clients such as Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance Publications Inc., and Jerry Speyer, plus 1998 revenue of 10 million at his 30-lawyer group. And Fried Frank aims to represent not one but two suitors, including Brookfield Financial Properties Inc., in the forthcoming contest for the country's biggest lease 10 million square feet of offices at New York's World Trade Center. In lease negotiations, lawyers routinely complain that Mr. Mechanic wastes time and money with his 50-page documents, while challenging every detail in their much shorter ones. Then, at some point, he will always pound on the table about something that surprises me because it seems so unexceptional, says attorney Philip Rosen of Weil Gotshal & Manges, who has sat across the table from Mr. Mechanic several times. Mr. Mechanic is nevertheless a very good lawyer, he adds. And his methods win clients. Real-estate investor Andrew Davidoff of Emmes Group of Cos. first encountered Mr. Mechanic 12 years ago representing a company that wanted to lease space in a building Mr. Davidoff then owned, Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City, N.J. Last year, buying out a partner in a difficult 50 million negotiation, he made sure Mr. Mechanic was working for him. He knows when to go on a rampage to get a deal closed, Mr. Davidoff says.
Stocks closed lower as investors' nervousness about inflation and interest rates again overshadowed upbeat earnings news. But Intel got a boost as it and Microsoft were picked as new components of the Dow Jones industrial average. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 47.80 at 10,302.13, having surrendered an earlier 59-point gain. The blue chips fell 120 points on Monday amid uneasiness over higher rates. Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 11.72 at 1281.91, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 4.48 at 2811.47. Stocks were hampered by continuing concerns about inflation, especially as the Federal Reserve's next policy-setting meeting approaches on Nov. 16. The jitters have caused investors to look past better-than-expected earnings reports, including news today of strong earnings from Lucent Technologies. The market is still under pressure, and the interest-rate question is probably a big part of it, said Charles White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average staged its strongest percentage gain since March, as a wave of optimism swept through the stock market following news of moderate third-quarter gains in inflation and labor costs. Many investors still believe that the Federal Reserve will raise its interest-rate target by another quarter point on Nov. 16. But now they are hoping that the Fed will be able to leave rates alone for a while afterward. Some even think the Fed may avoid raising rates in November. In the fourth-heaviest trading day ever on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow industrials advanced 227.64 points, or 2.19, to 10622.53, the highest percentage rise since they put on 2.84 on March 5, and the fourth-highest percentage gain of the year. The blue-chip index still stands 6 below its Aug. 25 record. But the Nasdaq Composite Index, heavy in popular technology stocks, now has zoomed to within 40.76 points, or 1.4, of its Oct. 11 record close of 2915.95. Yesterday, it rose 72.70, or 2.59, at 2875.22. Bonds also soared and the dollar was mixed.
Lockheed Martin Corp. shares fell 7.5 after two credit-rating agencies downgraded the defense company's debt. The downgrades signal that interest rates will increase on about 3 billion in commercial paper, according to credit experts. The downgrades by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services sent Lockheed Martin shares down 1.50 to close at 18.5625 in New York Stock Exchange 4 p.m. trading. The stock has dropped from a 52-week high of about 56.75, as a series of management and program problems have emerged in the past year. Some of the new ratings are at the lowest possible level in the investment-grade category. The drops stem from a Lockheed Martin forecast last week indicating that year-2000 cash flow will drop to less than 500 million from about 900 million estimated in late September. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., also said its year-2000 earnings are likely to be about 1 a share, instead of the 2.15 a share forecast in late September. Lockheed Martin has faced serious production and sales problems in certain of its units making satellites, rockets and some military aircraft. Wall Street experts said the most dramatic effect of the credit-agency downgrades would be the increased interest rates applied to the 3 billion or so of commercial paper the company has used for short-term borrowing. The paper typically features a variable interest rate. Another effect could be to trigger further sales of the stock by institutional holders. Analysts speculated some of that selling already has begun.
Tech-stock enthusiasm overcame interest-rate worries yet again, pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to a fifth consecutive record close and a second day above 3000. Nervousness ahead of today's announcement of closely watched October employment data produced some late-day selling, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed up 30.58 points, or 0.29, at 10639.64. The Nasdaq composite, which closed above 3000 for the first time Wednesday, surged 27.44, or 0.91, to 3055.95. Bonds advanced and the dollar was mixed. People are shifting from worries about interest rates to optimism about technology investment, said Robert Gasser, head of U.S. stock trading at J.P. Morgan. Fading worries about year-2000 computer-clock problems help to explain the strength of the Nasdaq composite, which is dominated by technology stocks such as Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems. Bond investors until recently feared the Fed was falling behind in combating inflation and would be forced to raise shortterm interest-rate targets by half a percentage point at its Nov. 16 policy meeting, said Scott Graham, chief government bond trader at Prudential Securities.
WASHINGTON -- Good news concerning the U.S. economy continued last week as the October unemployment rate dropped a notch to its lowest level in 29 years and wage gains remained tame. Job growth was solid, but wage pressures were completely absent in October, said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. The inflation threat has receded yet again. The new numbers, combined with some signs the economy may be slowing, will bolster those inside the Federal Reserve arguing against an interest-rate increase when policy makers meet Nov. 16. The anemic growth in wages, in particular, gives Fed officials more breathing room to see whether the economy is slowing on its own, or whether growth can continue at the current pace without sparking inflation. The Fed will probably be on hold until March 21, 2000, said Rosanne Cahn, chief U.S. equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, describing what she calls benign wage inflation. Still, many analysts think the Fed will move next week.
What comes after Nasdaq 3000 Nasdaq 4000 or Nasdaq 2500 All the hoopla surrounding Nasdaq 3000 last week masked some interesting aspects of the Nasdaq Composite Index's rise to stock-market dominance The advance has been going on for longer than many investors realize, but of late it has been driven by a surprisingly small group of stocks. That raises a question When a stock index becomes so dominated by a handful of names, how long can the gains continue Some of those companies are going to be worth it, but I think the majority aren't going to be worth it, says David Mead, chief investment officer at Harris Bank. Ultimately you will have more democracy in the stock market, he adds, meaning that a wider group of stocks will start to perform better. Then, investors will realize that many of the top companies are priced too high. He still likes networking colossus Cisco Systems, for example, but he has his doubts about software mammoth Microsoft. The antitrust ruling against Microsoft, announced after markets closed on Friday, throws an additional cloud over the stock, which as it happens was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average just last week. Of course, experienced investors have been warning for years now that the highfliers could fall to earth. Up to now, it hasn't happened. And certainly, no one was worrying much last week.
According to the latest mutual-fund returns, the U.S. has been surpassed by the rest of the world, and portfolio managers say that trend could continue. International-stock mutual funds are up an average 17 this year through Friday. Despite the recent record-shattering move by the Nasdaq Composite Index, the average U.S. diversified stock fund lags behind its foreign counterpart with a 13 return through Friday, according to fund-tracker Lipper Inc. There could be more of the same in the coming months. I think international markets will continue to outperform the U.S. stock market, but perhaps not the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, said Irene Cheng, lead manager of Scudder International Fund. Ms. Cheng's assertion stems from her belief Japan is dead serious about turning around its economy. David Lui, who manages Strong International Stock Fund, agrees. A number of secular trends in Japan bode well for a lasting economic recovery, he says. Companies in Japan are restructuring, instituting layoffs and selling unprofitable divisions, moves they hadn't undertaken before. In addition, Mr. Lui says, individual investors in Japan are tiptoeing back into the market after they got so badly burned in the early 1990s, and that's a very bullish signal. A year ago, Japan's markets were starting to dig out from a devastating financial crisis. Meanwhile, European markets were thriving, in part because of optimism over the European Union's unified economy and the then-coming euro monetary unit. This year, things have reversed Japan has performed well, while Europe seems to have been a victim of its own success. But don't count the Continent out yet, managers say, there is room for improvement.
One of the big problems that most of us have in life is that we never get to read our own obituaries, which would be our best chance to see people saying nice things about us. But high-profile corporate chieftains who announce their departures don't have this problem. They get to hear all that nice stuff while they're still around, because retirement stories strongly resemble obits, except that the subject is still alive and kicking. As witness the gushing and slobbering over General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch last week after he mentioned on a TV show that he plans to retire in April 2001. Welch would then be 65, and he would have had a nice, round 20 years at the helm of GE. Welch, the highest-profile corporate manager in the world--not to be confused with Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates, who's a founder, not merely a manager--is one of those people who make you feel good about subscribing to the Great Man Theory of business the idea that one person can make a huge difference. No matter how much of Welch's success you ascribe to historical forces and luck--the economy was dead in the water, with interest rates at 20 percent, when he took over, and it is roaring ahead now--it's clear that a good part of what's happened at GE since Welch took over in 1981 must have a lot to do with the man and the people he picked as subordinates. GE's stock price has risen from 4.18 34 adjusted for four stock splits on March 31, 1981, the day before he took over, to 134 yesterday. That 3,100 percent increase is more than triple the 900 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during that period. GE stock has risen 20.5 percent a year, compounded, compared with 13.2 for the S&P. But even as the encomiums pile up for Welch, known as Neutron Jack in his younger days for vaporizing jobs while leaving buildings intact, it's time to play my traditional role as skunk at the garden party. Welch is clearly very, very, very good. But as effective as his leadership has been in helping GE transform itself from an old- line industrial company into a sleek, finance-oriented conglomerate, it's not yet clear how good a manager Welch is. How can I say that Because picking a worthy successor is one of the most vital elements of managing. Since we don't know who Welch's successor is or how worthy he all the leading candidates are men will prove to be, I think it's too early to call Welch a management god. This may sound like nitpicking, but please bear with me. Consider, if you will, what's happened to Coca-Cola Co. since the charismatic and wonderfully well-regarded Roberto Goizueta died in 1997. He was on the same level as Welch in the business pantheon. But Goizueta's handpicked successor, Douglas Ivester, has had nothing but trouble since taking over the Coke chairmanship. Similar fates have befallen the people who succeeded two other well-regarded, visionary corporate chieftains Charles Lazarus, who retired as Toys R Us Inc. chief executive in 1994, and Anthony O'Reilly, who retired from H.J. Heinz Co. last year. Lazarus and O'Reilly were good leaders--but not, in my humble opinion, good managers. It's a bad reflection on them that their successors all seem to have had feet of clay. Hmm. It makes you wonder whether these guys were really as good as they seemed to be when they left office. And whether they'd have had trouble if they'd stayed around. Why does this matter Because it's important to keep perspective and not get swept away by conventional wisdom. Reporting about the personalities and peccadilloes of corporate managers has in large part replaced reporting about the corporations they run--both in the media world and on Wall Street. That's partly because people are generally more interesting than companies, partly because they're easier to analyze.
BP Amoco PLC, taking a further step in its cost-cutting efforts, is expected to announce today that it will transfer much of its U.S. accounting and back-office operations to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in a 1.1 billion, 10-year deal. The transaction is expected to be among the largest of its kind in the fastgrowing business-outsourcing industry, in which companies have been unloading functions that once were thought inseparable in a multinational corporation. PricewaterhouseCoopers executives credited technology with enabling such outsourcing, making it possible to conceive of a company that concentrates on areas where it has an advantage and leaves noncore functions to others. It's a relatively new and emerging way for large organizations like BP Amoco to focus on what they do best and improve their performance, said Ray Bayley, partner in charge of business-process outsourcing at the accounting firm. Under the deal, the oil giant's backoffice and accounting operations in Tulsa, Okla., Chicago and Houston will be taken over by PricewaterhouseCoopers. About 1,200 employees, mostly in Tulsa, will be transferred from BP Amoco to the accounting firm, but there won't be employee reductions or salary cuts. PricewaterhouseCoopers will assume the financial-reporting, accounts-payable and accounting responsibilities for BP Amoco's chemical and oil-exploration and production units in the U.S., excluding Alaska. The U.S. refining and marketing operation isn't part of the arrangement. The sides are currently negotiating a deal for the Canadian operations that could be announced early next year. PricewaterhouseCoopers will also take over the acquisition, maintenance and upgrading of technology linked with providing the services.
The multitrillion-dollar market in privately arranged financial derivatives does not need government regulation and should not be subject to U.S. futures laws, top U.S. regulators said yesterday. In a long-awaited report that eased market fears, the regulators recommended that Congress rewrite the Commodity Exchange Act CEA, which governs U.S. futures trading, to provide clear legal certainty for widely used financial derivatives. Derivatives are investments whose values are linked to underlying factors such as interest rates or currency exchange rates. The Bank for International Settlements has estimated that the total notional amount of outstanding over-the-counter derivatives contracts reached 80 trillion in 1998. Market participants have worried for years that U.S. futures regulators could try to assert jurisdiction over the currently unregulated OTC market. That might have thrown the legal status of many contracts into question. A special working group of U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC, studied the issue for more than a year. Congress will use the group's findings in a rewrite of U.S. futures laws due to be completed next year.
Older Internet stocks still are swinging, but they aren't leading the band anymore. As the Nasdaq Stock Market has romped to repeated new highs in recent weeks, it has done so without the help of many Internet stocks that had been so hot in April. The Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, though up 59 since its August low, remains 15 below its peak of mid-April the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 22 in the same period. Hardly any of the stocks in the capitalization -- weighted Internet index now trade anywhere near those highs. America Online and Yahoo both trade within 20 of their peaks, but the average of the index's 40 components still was down 38 from its 52-week high as of Thursday. With three Internet-related initial public offerings of stock in the past three weeks rocketing into the ranks of the top five first-day gains ever, it is clear the Internet party isn't over. It has just moved to a different neighborhood, leaving some lonely guests at the old one. This time last year, e-tailers a la Amazon.com were all the rage, says David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments, an investment-research and advisory firm in New York. Now e-tailers, led by Amazon's petulant preference for expansion over profit, are passe, and now it's b-to-b business to business commerce and networking. Of course, with the broad market rallying, some big Internet blue chips could well soon achieve new highs. Signs of modest economic activity and low inflationary pressure helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average soar 174.02 points, or 1.64, to 10769.32 on Friday, although uncertainty remains on whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates when its policy-making body meets tomorrow. The Nasdaq composite gained 23.86, or 0.75, to 3221.15, its third consecutive record and its 10th in 11 days. For the week, the Dow industrials gained 64.52, or 0.6 Nasdaq rose 118.86, or 3.8.
When the software's for rent, what can investors buy The abbreviation ASP is suddenly as much of a stock-market buzzword as e-commerce and dot-com once were. And just as with the earlier manias, some traders already have made a bundle while others have lost their shirts. ASP, or application service provider, is technology lingo for a company that rents out access to computer software and hardware to business customers, often providing the access over the Internet. Bullish investors believe that ASP is the Next Big Thing and that it will revolutionize how small and medium-size companies approach technology. Before long, the theory goes, everybody from mom-and-pop retailers to steel warehouses will embrace the notion of outsourcing complicated stuff such as accounting programs and productivity software, saving themselves time and money -- and creating stock-market winners among the ASP providers. Such beliefs already have created wild rides in the stock market. As investors have caught outsourcing fever, ASP firms such as the pioneering company USinternetworking Inc. and, more recently, Breakaway Solutions Inc. have enjoyed wildly popular initial public offerings.
Retirement is like a long vacation in Vegas. The goal is to enjoy these years to the fullest, but not so fully that you run out of money. It is a dicey endeavor, involving tricky issues of longevity and investment returns. As you try to figure out how much you can spend once retired, take a cue from the accompanying tables, which were put together by T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore mutual-fund company. To use the tables, you have to decide how long your retirement might last, what stock-bond mix you will hold and what percentage of your portfolio's value you might withdraw in the first year of retirement. After the first year, you are assumed to step up the amount you withdraw, along with inflation. The tables don't provide definitive answers. Instead, like a gambler, you have to play the percentages. The answer you pluck from the tables is the chance that you will make it through retirement, without running out of money.
What, us worry Some investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its policy meeting today some think it won't. Both camps seem to think that whatever the Fed does, it won't hurt too much. In that only-slightly-nervous environment, stocks were virtually flat yesterday, one of the least pronounced moves recently on a day before a Fed policy meeting. The Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by technology darlings such as Cisco Systems, fell only a hair after setting a string of 11 records in 12 trading days. It inched down 1.61 points to 3219.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a comparable 8.57 points to 10760.75. Bonds rose slightly and the dollar fell. For the first time in months, noted Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at Dreyfus Corp., people expect the announcement to be a nonevent. And the general view, he adds, is that a nonevent is good for stocks.
BERLIN -- For the first time in years, the economies of nearly all the world's industrialized regions are going in the right direction, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said. The agency's new semiannual world economic outlook projects that the OECD area, which consists of 29 industrialized countries, will expand by an inflation-adjusted 3 this year and next -- 1.5 percentage points higher than forecast six months ago -- before slowing to around 2.5 in 2001. The slowdown which occurred late in 1998 has ended, the OECD said. For the first time in several years, output levels in all the major OECD regions might be moving toward their respective potential, that is, toward full employment, albeit marginally so in Japan. Japan is expected to grow at only 1.5 a year during the next couple of years, according to the report, but even that economy is showing some positive signs. These changes reflect mainly unexpected near-term momentum of the U.S. economy, a stronger and more rapid resumption of growth in Japan, and particularly Korea, as well as a slightly better outlook for the European Union, the report said.
NEW YORK -- The Nasdaq Stock Market, by some measures, is having a great year. Day after day, trading volume and indexes tracking the market's technology stocks have hit records. But for Nasdaq itself, which likes to bill itself as the tech market for tech companies, all that volume and the technology needed to keep up with it have been double-edged swords. The 17-minute outage of key Nasdaq trade-reporting and order-routing systems Tuesday not only crippled the market in the half-hour leading up to the 4 p.m. EST close -- it also resulted in incorrect day-end values for the Nasdaq Composite Index and for certain individual stocks, including six of the vigorously traded Nasdaq 100-index tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite's actual finish Tuesday was 3295.52, not 3293.05 as reported in many news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal. The index ended yesterday at 3269.39, down 26.13, on record volume of 1.65 billion shares. There were delays in morning trading, but they were less severe than Tuesday's problems. While Wall Street traders said Tuesday's shutdown was the worst of the recent problems, they also said it wasn't the first problem they'd experienced with Nasdaq's technology and in particular with SelectNet, the heavily trafficked e-mail system used to send orders and report trades. SelectNet problems, they say, have gone on for months and are particularly pronounced on days like Tuesday when volumes surge.
U.S. businesses and government agencies are being forced to spend about 100 billion to keep the year 2000 glitch from crashing their computers, making a simple two-digit programming bug the most expensive peacetime catastrophe in modern history. But the vast electronic repair effort, which has commanded an unparalleled mobilization of people, money and executive attention in the past two years, is not likely to slow down the surging American economy, the Commerce Department predicted yesterday. Comparing Y2K to a tangled shoelace for a world-class marathon runner, the department also forecast that any problems created by malfunctioning computers--either domestically or overseas--will have an insignificant impact on the U.S. economy. Any glitches that pop up next year should not hurt our economic growth, said Commerce Secretary William Daley, who noted that the Y2K price tag works out to 365 for every American citizen. Is this a lot of money Absolutely, Daley said. But the potential cost of not doing anything was far greater.
Pretty soon, you may not recognize the money in your pocket. The U.S. Mint began full-scale production of a new 1 coin yesterday, a gold-colored depiction of the Native American explorer Sacagawea that replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin. The new coin is part of a revamping of U.S. money that includes new 5 and 10 bills next year, which have the presidents' images set off-center. Twenty-dollar bills and larger denominations already have been changed. With the new 1 coin, dubbed the Golden Dollar, the Mint is banking on an ambitious marketing plan, a new design and 20 years of inflation since the Susie's introduction to help the new coin succeed. Officials and even the coin's proponents say its chances of replacing the paper dollar are virtually nil. But coin-dependent entities such as mass-transit systems, the Postal Service and the 23 billion vending industry are still hoping the Sacagawea dollar will provide a boon. We're coming to a time when the dollar coin will probably be more useful than people would like to admit, said Rep. Michael Castle R., Del., who wrote the 1997 law paving the way for the new coins. Because the cost of things is higher, there are more items you simply have to spend a dollar on, so this is a good solution. The new coins are about the size of Susan B. Anthony dollars, will be in circulation by early 2000, and are made of an alloy of manganese, brass and copper.
Federal Reserve officials have grown increasingly unhappy with the impact on financial markets of their new effort to inform the public whenever they change their view about the likelihood of near-term changes in interest rates, according to the minutes of an Oct. 5 policymaking session released today. At that meeting, members of the policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, took no action on rates but adopted a directive that was biased toward higher rates. That decision sparked a discussion about what has happened since the FOMC agreed at the end of last year to begin announcing such moves immediately. In the past, the adoption of a biased directive was disclosed only when the minutes of a meeting were released six to eight weeks later, so market participants usually paid relatively little attention to it. This May was the first time the FOMC adopted a bias toward raising rates and announced it right away. Financial market participants reacted to the announcement, to the dismay of many of the committee members, virtually as if rates had been increased. At the next meeting, at the end of June, the target for overnight rates was raised and the committee went back to a neutral directive-- not because another rate increase wasn't likely but because the members feared that that if they said that they were still leaning toward higher rates, the market would overreact again. At the Oct. 5 meeting, FOMC members observed that the recent practice of making such announcements had led to some misinterpretations of the committee's intentions and seemed to have added to volatility in financial markets, the minutes said.
It's no coincidence that check-cashing businesses locate in poor and working-class neighborhoods. These operations, which usually move in as commercial banks move out, can be found in pawn shops, liquor stores or their own storefronts. But no matter where they are found, check-cashing businesses have two things in common They are unregulated by the state, and they fleece the poor. For a substantial fee, these enterprises will cash a paycheck, sell a money order or facilitate the payment of utility or other bills. However, their real pay dirt comes with the payday loan. The payday loan, already banned in New Jersey and New York, is a process by which people can borrow against their next paycheck at interest rates nearly 20 times the state's 33 percent interest rate cap. For example, a person who wants to borrow 300 on his next paycheck writes a postdated check for 379. The check casher holds the check until the borrower's next payday. For another 79 fee, the loan can be rolled over for two more weeks. Calculated on an annual basis, the 79 comes to an interest rate of 600 percent. Legislation will be introduced during the next Maryland legislative session to impose state regulation on the check-cashing industry. Another bill will be introduced to prohibit payday loans. Of course, the industry claims these cash advances are not loans at all but deferred deposits. But several states, including Virginia, have won court cases that found that deferred deposits were indeed loans and that the interest charged was in excess of the interest caps mandated by those states.
The outcome of this year's budget battle could hardly have been more disappointing. Probably 95 of what Clinton wanted, he got, lamented Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Mr. Specter's fellow Republicans then added billions more for themselves. Result a pork-filled budget of 1.75 trillion, bigger than the entire economy of France. But here's some surprising news The federal government is getting smaller, at least relative to the size of the economy as a whole. This year, for the first time in more than 25 years, federal spending slipped below 20 of gross domestic product. As the chart nearby shows, this percentage has been shrinking throughout the 1990s it is projected at 19.3 next year. That's still too big, but it's down from 24 just 15 years ago. True, much of this progress is a result of post-Cold War defense cutbacks, but even domestic spending is receding relative to private-sector output. This benign fiscal state of affairs seems incomprehensible, given a Congress that has proved itself incapable of cutting nearly any federal agency budgets and a president who has stopped paying even lip service to small government. But America's miracle economy, helped along by Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp's supply-side tax policies, is outgrowing the budget. The federal budget has grown by 132 in 1982, but the GDP has increased by 176. And Americans' financial wealth has grown to 32 trillion from 7 trillion, four times as fast as federal expenditures. The trend has been quite different for most of the 20th century. Federal spending as a share of GDP rose to 24 in 1982 from 4 in 1932. Who gets credit for turning things around First, Mr. Reagan, who won the Cold War, chopped punitive tax rates roughly in half and made the case that big government was the problem, not the solution. Second, Paul Volcker and his successor, Alan Greenspan, who ended double-digit inflation and returned America to price stability. Third, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Steve Case and all the other high-tech entrepreneurs who made possible today's booming information economy. All this progress has happened without any serious effort to cut federal spending. If the next president adopts the right small-government policies, he could shrink federal spending to 15 or even 10 of GDP. To get there will require a combination of modest fiscal disciplinary measures to slow federal spending and a prosperity agenda aimed at coaxing economic growth up to 4 or 5 a year. The policy prescriptions necessary include personalized accounts for Social Security, a flat 20 alternative maximum tax with unlimited IRAs, medical savings accounts for health care, unilateral free trade, the abolition of corporate welfare and an ironclad commitment to keep the Internet tax- and regulation-free.
On a packed square where Bulgarians celebrated the end of their Stalinist government a decade ago, President Clinton praised this Eastern European nation today for turning its eyes and ambitions to the West. He promised more help from the United States if Bulgaria continues its movement toward democracy and a reliable economic system. As several thousand people cheered and waved flags in the broad square before the Nevski Cathedral, with a full moon just starting to rise, Clinton hailed Bulgaria for throwing off communism and holding fair elections, even as he acknowledged the path has been bumpy. Communist rulers . . . fed you lies, yet you sought the truth, he said. When the Cold War ended, it took much longer for the ground here to thaw. Bulgaria, like Romania, has found it difficult to evolve from life as a Soviet satellite, suffering crippling inflation and unstable governments until 1997, when Petar Stoyanov was elected president and the economy began to find its feet. Clinton spent a busy day here not only to encourage that transition but also to draw a distinction between Bulgaria and its neighbor, Yugoslavia. While many Bulgarians disapproved of the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict, Stoyanov's government did not openly condemn the NATO campaign. Clinton, the first U.S. president to visit this country, returned the favor today. Standing next to Stoyanov, he told the crowd, you stood with NATO when the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, threatened the promise of an undivided, democratic Europe.
Investors pulled back ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, selling highflying technology names and other stocks in order to take profits. The hot, tech-driven Nasdaq Composite Index broke its recent streak of records, falling 49.69 points, or 1.46, to 3342.87. Amid continuing fears of inflation and rising interest rates, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 93.89, or 0.85, to 10995.63, slipping below the 11000 level. The blue chips still are up almost 20 for 1999, and the Nasdaq composite is up more than 52. The declines hit almost every stock group except airline stocks, which benefited from plans for a fare increase. Bonds and the dollar were mixed. It was just a breather in technology after a remarkable string of new highs, noted Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber. But the way some of the interest-rate sensitive indexes have been acting has given some people cause for concern, he said, adding, You're heading into the last month of the year and performance has been fantastic. It could be sideways to down for a while here. Interest-rate worries were reflected in bank stocks, which fell for a fifth straight trading day, and in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which now is down more than 15 from its June record.
The U.S. economy grew at a hefty 5.5 percent annual rate in the July-September period, a remarkably rapid pace for an economic expansion only a few months shy of its ninth birthday, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The U.S. economy remains in overdrive, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. We expect the fourth-quarter gross domestic product to rise at about a 5 percent rate and then to moderate slightly to a 3.5 percent to 4 percent rate during 2000. Last month, Commerce had estimated third-quarter economic growth at a somewhat slower but still strong 4.8 percent annual rate. It revised that estimate upward yesterday on the basis of more complete information about economic developments during the period. Even with such rapid growth and an unemployment rate just above 4 percent, inflation remained extremely low during the summer. Prices paid by consumers, businesses and governments for their purchases--regardless of whether the goods and services were produced in the United States or imported--rose at a 1.7 percent rate in the third quarter. Excluding the volatile prices of food and energy items, the increase was at only a 1.2 percent rate.
The Nasdaq Stock Market sprinted to another record today as investors gave Internet retailers a boost at the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. But stocks overall delivered a mixed performance in light post-Thanksgiving trading. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.31, to 3447.81, its 16th record close in four weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.46, to 1416.62. For the week, the Nasdaq rose 78.56 points, and is up 57 percent so far this year. The Dow dropped 14.98 for the week while the S&P 500 slipped 5.38. A tremendous pocket of strength in technology is pulling up the Nasdaq, said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. But he cautioned that, overall, declining stocks are outpacing advancing ones, which should raise a yellow flag of caution for investors. Stock gains were held back by inflationary concerns spurred by a Commerce Department report today that Americans' personal income in October rose 1.3 percent, its biggest jump in more than five years, and had increased more than twice as fast as spending.
Editor's note Going public--that is, selling a company's shares to public investors for the first time--is the dream of many an entrepreneur and of the people who go to work for many of today's start-up companies. Mike Mills left his reporting job at The Washington Post in April to join one such firm as the company's vice president of business development. This is his story of participating in the company's venture into the public stock market. Our company's chief executive is about to break one of the cardinal rules of an IPO roadshow Never attempt a live demonstration of your product. We've implored him not to do this. Should the product, for some reason, fail to perform, the presentation is finished. To drive that point home, our chief financial officer nervously recounts a legendary anecdote from his former employer The guy says, 'See our new Styrofoam cup It's lighter but stronger Let's pour water into it.' Then, whoosh The bottom of the cup mysteriously gives out. Show over. But the cautionary tale doesn't sway David Oros, president and chief executive of Aether Systems Inc. Rather, it merely strengthens his resolve. So there I stand, along the wall in an auditorium at Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Wall Street headquarters, wondering whether my boss's determination will pay off or do us in. Though our actual roadshow won't begin until tomorrow, we were reminded beforehand that this meeting--to the entire equity sales staff at Merrill Lynch, our lead investment bank--is every bit as important as our direct pitch to investors. If the demo crashes, these sales agents will hardly be enthused to get on the phone and push Aether's first publicly traded shares out the door.
The furthest thought from Zachary Skolnik's mind is retirement. Any money he makes in the stock market or at work, he's aiming to spend. The San Franciscan has 4,000 in an Internet stock, Excite At Home Corp., and fancies himself a bit of a day trader and entrepreneur. He buys and sells shares through the Datek Online service, and when he isn't writing programs for a financial Web site for 7.50 an hour, he's building computers from scratch, mostly from scrap parts he buys online. Someday, he hopes to run his own software company -- someday after 2002, when he graduates from high school. Mr. Skolnik is only 15 years old. Hopefully, I can make some extra money and have more to spend, he says of his investments and part-time job. There's also the fact that I'm learning a lot of important things for later on in life. Say hello to the Millennial Generation.
The worse it got, the better the economy worked for most companies and consumers in the Washington region -- and most Americans, for that matter. Cheap goods from Asia helped restrain inflation, boosting U.S. consumers' buying power. The Federal Reserve nudged interest rates down to head off a wider crisis, making housing, business expansion and consumer credit purchases more affordable. The Asian crisis was terrific for the American economy, except for manufacturing. Ironically, the recovery there will have the opposite effect, said Anirban Basu, director of applied economics at Towson University's RESI, a regional economic research institute. Exporters in Virginia and Maryland whose sales to the Pacific Rim were battered by the crisis are due for better results this year and next. We expect exports from Virginia will improve next year, said Ann Battle, an economist with Chmura Economics and Analytics in Richmond. Some of that should be evident already.
Sales of existing homes fell sharply in October as rising interest rates continued to take a toll on consumers. Nevertheless, sales remain brisk by historical standards and are on track to set a record this year. In October, sales declined 6.6, according to the National Association of Realtors, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units. That was down from September's 5.13 million rate and was 3 below the 4.94 million level set in October 1998. An increase in mortgage rates is translating into a slowdown in home sales -- exactly what the Fed wanted when it raised interest rates three times this year, said Kory Bockman, an economist with the NAR in Washington. Still, home sales are likely to top 5.20 million units this year, besting last year's 4.97 million mark and the fourth consecutive record year. It's still a good time to be a Realtor, said Mr. Bockman.
The splendid Benaroya symphony hall, built with donations from Seattle's prosperous global firms, was crammed over the weekend with an impressively global assortment of globalization's critics. Along the sleek slate-and-steel hallway, activists from five continents clustered by the latte bars African campaigners for debt relief, Brazilian defenders of rain forests, Indians opposed to neocolonial investment, European haters of beef hormones, Canadians concerned about everything. Inside the auditorium, a marathon teach-in was underway, convened to denounce the World Trade Organization as one of the world's most powerful, secretive, undemocratic and dangerous bodies. And yet this festival of activism suggested a rather different notion. Perhaps the activists themselves are the real stealth world government Last time trade liberalizing talks were launched, in Uruguay in 1986, 12 nongovernmental organizations registered to observe the process. But the reach and clout of NGOs have since expanded marvelously, courtesy of the Internet. NGOs set the agenda for the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and lobbied governments to attend they publicized the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico in 1994, so preventing the Mexican government from suppressing it violently. Three years ago Jessica Mathews, now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested that centuries of governmental dominance might finally be ending. If that was plausible three years ago, it now seems even more compelling. In 1997 a loose alliance of 350 NGOs from 23 countries set out to ban land mines they soon persuaded 122 nations to sign on to a treaty. In 1998 another NGO alliance, this time reckoned to number 600 groups in nearly 70 countries, sank a painstakingly negotiated treaty on multilateral investment. This year yet another coalition, known as Jubilee 2000, led an international lobbying effort for Third World debt relief. During the recent budget fight, Jubilee pressure had much to do with the congressional Republicans' last-minute assent to provide money for debt cancellation. Fresh from those victories, the NGO community has descended on Seattle to take on the international trading system. Many of the lead players from previous NGO victories are there they greet each other in hallways with the camaraderie of veterans. Their rhetoric paints the World Trade Organization as a proto-government possessed of frightening power, but their own clout is just as striking. The WTO has a budget of just 80 million a year and a staff of fewer than 500. NGO coalitions wield more money and have thousands of expert delegates in Seattle.
Informix Corp. and Sybase Inc., two longtime makers of database software, announced acquisitions to help boost growth. Informix said it agreed to acquire Ardent Software Inc., a developer of data-warehousing technology, for 772.5 million in stock. Sybase agreed to buy an Internet financial-services company called Home Financial Network Inc. for 143.3 million in cash and stock. Both software companies have been diversifying beyond databases, a market led by rival Oracle Corp. In buying Ardent, of Westboro, Mass., Informix gets a larger position in data warehouses, a comprehensive form of database that can combine information from many sources in a company. James Pickrel, senior analyst at Hambrecht & Quist LLC in San Francisco, said some Informix customers already have been using Ardent software to combine data from older computer systems and Web sites dedicated to electronic commerce. Now they can go to one source for that technology, he said. Jean-Yves Dexmier, Informix's chief executive officer, said we are going to grow revenue faster as a result of the acquisition. Under terms of the agreement, Informix will offer 80 million shares, or 3.5 shares of Informix common stock for each outstanding Ardent share, and assume all outstanding Ardent options. At the close of Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 4 p.m., Informix shares fell 1.3438 to 9.6556, while Ardent shares jumped 5.50 to 31.75.
The nation's 4.1 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in nearly three decades, was unchanged last month as hefty productivity gains allowed strong economic growth to continue without adding to inflation, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Employers added 234,000 payroll jobs, mostly in the services sector and construction, while average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent. The evidence of strong growth based on productivity gains and no hint of inflationary pressure from wages triggered rallies in both the stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 247.12 points yesterday to close at 11,286.18, and in a less exuberant rally the price of a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 8.12 12 per 1,000 in face value. Analysts said the markets were happy because the lack of any hint of inflation flowing from the low unemployment rate suggested that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise short-term interest rates in coming months. The report was greeted with great fanfare at the White House because November's rise in payroll jobs pushed total job creation since President Clinton took office in January 1993 past the 20 million mark. In his nearly seven years in office, payroll employment has increased by nearly 3 million a year to 129.5 million and the jobless rate has dropped from 7.3 percent to 4.1 percent.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks rose solidly Friday, although the group's gains were considerably more contained than those of the broad market and blue-chip stocks. The overall Nasdaq Stock Market was up sharply, posting steeper gains than most of the other major stock-market indexes, the biggest exception being the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at a record level for the second straight session. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 4.14, or 0.90, to 464.58, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 67.85, or 1.97, to 3520.63. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials surged 247.12, or 2.24, to 11286.18. Stocks pushed higher at the opening following the release of the November employment report, which showed that employers eased the pace of hiring. The benign jobs data have led many analysts and investors to presume that the Federal Reserve won't see a need to raise interest rates for the next several months. The small-cap and Nasdaq markets were driven higher by the strength of technology stocks, with software and Internet issues setting the pace.
AT&T tells the world that it's a broadband communications company ready to serve your every need, be it a wireless phone, long- distance service, an Internet connection or cable TV. In reality, though, what AT&T has really become is a marketing company. And what it's marketing most successfully lately is its stock. AT&T's full-bore stock-promotion campaign explains why the company announced yesterday that it's creating a separate tracking stock, to be called AT&T Wireless Group, that will be tied to--duh--AT&T's wireless business. News of AT&T's plans, reported in the Nov. 22 Wall Street Journal but not confirmed by the company until yesterday, sent AT&T stock up almost 25 percent in just four trading days. On the fifth day, the stock ran up some more, but that was because of a buy recommendation issued by an influential telecommunications analyst, Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney, who had been bearish on AT&T for years. Why in the world would a tracking stock that changes absolutely nothing about AT&T's basic business add 35 billion to its stock- market value in just four days As we used to say at Forbes magazine, it's the principle of When the ducks quack, feed them. Or, as marketers say, give the customers what they want. Wall Street loves wireless companies and it also loves tracking stocks, which are securities tied to a particular business within a company. A wireless tracker Such a deal. AT&T biggies have been grumbling for months, because the company's stock had been trading in the 40s even though Wall Street analysts valued AT&T's assets at 60 to 70 a share. So AT&T is scattering duck food, trying to put its stock on the fast quack. The fact that companies cater to Wall Street's ever-changing whims isn't exactly news. But AT&T's providential rise from 46.56 14 on Nov. 19 the last market day before the Journal story to 57.43 34 on Nov. 26 came at a very convenient time. For starters, through Nov. 19, AT&T had way underperformed arch competitor MCI WorldCom. AT&T's stock had fallen 8 percent for the year, while WorldCom's had risen 26 percent. The surge closed most of the gap. For companies like AT&T and WorldCom, stock price is more than just a way to keep score.
DETROIT -- For the first time in years, the U.S. auto industry is starting to pay attention to the price of gasoline. Although inflation-adjusted prices at the pump remain near historic lows, a 31 jump this year, to an average 1.35 a gallon in November, sounded a warning bell for the auto industry that buyers could put fresh emphasis on fuel efficiency. That isn't likely to threaten what's expected to be a record-breaking year of auto sales in the U.S. in 1999, but it could ease demand for sport-utility vehicles, which are among the least fuel-efficient vehicles. Sport-utility vehicles have nearly doubled their share of U.S. sales, to 18 this year from just under 10 in 1994, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. More important for auto makers, profits from SUVs are huge, while small cars remain loss leaders. The big question for the industry is whether gasoline prices will rise high enough -- and stay there long enough -- to spook many buyers into shifting to more fuel-efficient vehicles. In the long term, the industry could respond to such demand with a raft of technologies that it is developing, from advanced internal-combustion engines to hybrid power plants that use electric power to cut fuel consumption. In the short term, however, renewed consumer consciousness about fuel efficiency could slow sales of SUVs. James Holden, president of DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. arm, which depends for much of its profits on sales of SUVs such as the Dodge Durango, says he expects average U.S. gasoline prices to rise to about 1.50 a gallon and stay there for a couple months. If prices rise much higher than that and stay there long, they would cause some shift in consumer demand to smaller trucks, he figures. But he doesn't see gasoline prices rising to a point where consumers would trade trucks for small cars. It's not going to get people to sell the Durango and the boat they tow, he says.
American Airlines parent AMR Corp. is expected to unveil plans for a 6.2 billion spinoff of its Sabre Holdings Corp. today and announce the hiring of a telecommunications executive to head the newly independent computer-services company, people familiar with the moves said. The spinoff, long sought by Wall Street, will split AMR in half and free Sabre to wheel and deal in the rapidly changing world of technology outsourcing and Internet-based travel sales. What is more, analysts and AMR executives have argued that neither the full value of American Airlines, the nation's second-largest airline, nor Sabre was reflected in the share price of AMR. When people do the math, it's clear the market has not fully valued the airline, one person familiar with the transaction said. AMR has taken Sabre as far as it can, and it has realized as much value for AMR shareholders as it knows how to do. About 17 of Sabre is publicly traded. AMR plans to spin off its 83 stake to AMR shareholders in March, subject to Internal Revenue Service approval as a tax-free transaction. AMR applied for IRS approval in the fall. AMR shareholders will receive 0.7 share of Sabre stock, valued at about 36 at yesterday's closing price, for each AMR share owned, people involved said. Sabre shareholders, including AMR, will receive a one-time dividend of about 5.50 a share, or a total of 675 million, prior to the spinoff. People involved said the payment is intended to repay AMR for the cash balance built at Sabre during AMR's ownership. AMR, which has worked to ward off possible debt-rating downgrades as it sheds more than half of its market value, will use the cash to bolster its balance sheet. Sabre, on the other hand, will borrow about 350 million for the dividend, damping earnings next year, because of increased interest expense on top of about 10 million transaction fees for the spinoff, people familiar with the terms said.
NEW YORK -- Bonds suffered their worst one-day plunge in more than four months as newly released data sparked concerns that the economy's continued head-turning growth will cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least once next year to keep inflation under wraps. In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury fell 1 1132, or 13.438 for a bond with 1,000 face value, to 97 1732. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.295. It was the benchmark bond's worst one-day performance since Aug. 6. Shorter-term securities also dropped. Two-year notes, for example, fell 632 to yield 6.045. Volume was 49.4 billion, higher than the average of the last week and last 30 days, according to GovPX Inc., which tracks trading volume at five of the six interdealer brokers. Investors were spooked by a stronger-than-expected retail-sales report for November. The Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 0.9, above the 0.5 increase economists expected. Excluding autos, however, sales were up 0.4, in line with forecasts. In addition, October sales were revised to show an overall increase of 0.3 from an unchanged reading in the initial report. As a result, what looked like slight slowing in consumer spending, and a possible precursor to a slowing economy, instead showed the economy may be overheating.
After two months of weak gains, a rebound in automobile purchases helped retail sales to a strong 0.9 percent increase last month as the Christmas selling season got going, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Sales were also strong at building supply and furniture stores, and those selling general merchandise and apparel. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month while the core portion of the consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.2 percent. Over the past 12 months, the core CPI rose 2.1 percent and the overall index was up 2.6 percent. The difference was due primarily to a 10.5 percent year-over-year increase in energy costs, which constitute about 7 percent of the CPI. In a third economic report released yesterday, Commerce said the United States had a record 89.9 billion deficit in its international transactions in the third quarter.
SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- Ask John McCain's campaign whom the presidential candidate consults for economic advice, and the first answer is, we'll get back to you. The second answer is Kevin Hassett, co-author of Dow 36,000, a super-bullish stock-market tome. But maybe the real answer is no one, since Mr. McCain recently fretted, during a GOP debate, that today's 11,000-point Dow is a stock-market bubble. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has platoons of economists who spent nine months assembling his tax cut. Sen. McCain has -- the top of his own head, which in a sense sums up the entire McCain candidacy. The medium is his message, and the medium is the man himself. This explains both his recent surge and his vulnerability as he tries to steal the GOP nomination from Mr. Bush. His war record and blunt political style are perfect for a year when prosperity and Bill Clinton have made character count more than issues. Just as Democrats turned to Jimmy Carter as the purest anti-Nixon after Watergate, many Republicans view Mr. McCain as the ideal anti-Clinton. Rightly offended by media adoration of Mr. McCain over campaign finance, some conservatives have missed this part of his grass-roots appeal. But the reality is as clear as Christmas in this key primary state, perhaps the most anti-Clinton in the country.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's term doesn't expire for another six months, but that hasn't stopped presidential candidates from offering President Clinton advice on reappointing him to a fourth four-year term as head of the central bank. Their comments have ranged from replacing Greenspan because he's doing a lousy job Steve Forbes and thinking others could do just as well Bill Bradley, to enthusiastic endorsement for his outstanding A-plus-plus performance Al Gore and extremely enthusiastic endorsement John McCain. During a Republican debate earlier this month, the Arizona senator said, If Mr. Greenspan should happen to die--God forbid--I would do like they did in the movie 'Weekend at Bernie's.'  Referring to a comedy in which two men take over a dead man's beach house, he said I'd prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him and keep him as long as I could. And President Clinton When asked about Greenspan's future at a news conference in July, he said I have, as you know, enjoyed a very good relationship, both personally and professionally, with Mr. Greenspan. I think he has done a terrific job. I have no idea whether he would even be willing to serve another term. He added that he expected to decide in a timely fashion. That, it turns out, is just what he is doing.
Stocks closed mostly lower today as bond yields soared to the highest level in more than two years on fear that the Federal Reserve will suggest Tuesday that interest-rate increases may be needed in the future to cool the nation's economic growth. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.16, to close at 11,144.27. At one point, the Dow had been up more than 50 points and was closing in on an all-time high. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index lost some of its early momentum but still finished with a gain of 30.81, closing at 3783.87, its 55th record high close of 1999. Stocks gave up early gains as the bond market faltered in midafternoon. The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7.81 per 1,000 invested, and its yield rose to 6.44 percent from 6.37 percent late Friday. The last time bonds closed with a higher yield was Sept. 15, 1997. The decline in bond prices was caused by worries about the Federal Reserve's last policymaking meeting of the year, set for Tuesday. Most analysts expect central bankers to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, but many are wary of a change to a tightening bias, which would mean the Fed is inclined to raise rates on any future signs of inflation.
NEW YORK -- Options traders focused on adjusting their positions, finding ways to make money even as they waited for a critical decision on interest rates. The central bank's policy-making panel ended its final meeting of 1999 yesterday without an interest-rate increase, but it surprised market watchers by maintaining a neutral monetary-policy stance. The options market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, fell 1.22 to 23.44, after it had climbed past 25.80 early in the session. Market watchers expect volatility to continue to ease heading into the holidays, but not for long. Volatility could relax a little, but with the next earnings season just around the corner, the anxiety will return to the market, said Paul Foster, 1010WallStreet.com's options strategist. Even before Bank One Corp. announced the retirement of Chairman and Chief Executive John B. McCoy, traders who managed to catch wind of the news began buying the bank's call options.
WASHINGTON AP -- The government recorded a budget deficit of 27.6 billion last month, much bigger than the 16.9 billion deficit posted for November 1998. The Treasury Department said that last month's revenue totaled 121.4 billion while expenditures came to 149 billion. Slipping tax collections for the month accounted for most of the difference between the November 1999 and November 1998 budget totals. For the first two months of fiscal year 2000, which began Oct. 1, the government is running a deficit of 54 billion. A budget surplus still is expected for all of 2000, however. The Clinton administration is predicting a 142.5 billion surplus for fiscal 2000 and 168.2 billion in 2001. For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the government reported a record surplus of 123.6 billion. ---
Low unemployment, low interest rates, a soaring stock market, virtually no inflation and high consumer confidence in the economy drove buyers to new-vehicle showrooms in record numbers in 1999, according to auto industry analysts and executives. But the really good news for automakers and their dealers was that a solid 48 percent of those buyers chose light trucks--pickups, vans, minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Trucks generally bring in more money than cars. For example, look at Ford's third-quarter 1999 performance. According to industry analysts, Ford had an average pretax profit of 953 on each vehicle that it sold in the United States in the third quarter. The automaker broke even on cars, generally losing money on smaller models such as the compact Contour sedan, while making up the losses on sales of large and luxury cars. But Ford earned an average of 2,540 on every pickup, sport- utility vehicle, van and minivan it delivered to consumers, analysts said. At the beginning of the year, if anyone had told me that we'd be looking at this kind of number, I would not have believed them, said Jim O'Connor, president of the Ford Division of Ford Motor Co. I don't think many people would've believed them.
Visions of doomsday comfortably behind them, investors continued pouring money into high-tech stocks today, pushing the Nasdaq composite index to yet another record. But while euphoria buoyed tech stocks on the first trading day of the year 2000, bond prices fell to their lowest levels since May amid rampant expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise rates to slow the economy, now that the Y2K bug is quashed. Those fears also pounded financial stocks, dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The Fed is increasingly frustrated by the tightening of labor markets, and I would not be surprised if they raised rates once or twice this year, said Eugene Ludwig, former comptroller of the currency and managing general partner of District-based Cornerstone Financial Partners. That expectation was stoked by the release of a National Association of Purchasing Managers' index of factory activity showing evidence of continued economic strength. The index registered 55.5 in December, indicating that U.S. manufacturing expanded for an 11th straight month. On Friday, an employment report will show how strong wages have been and suggest whether the tight labor market is creating inflation pressures. Higher interest rates would hurt profits at financial companies and the return on outstanding long-term bonds.
FRANKFURT -- European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said an expected increase in euro-area inflation isn't cause for immediate concern, but he warned against excessive union wage demands based on that rise. At the ECB's monthly news conference, Mr. Duisenberg repeated the euro has strong upward potential based on improving prospects for euro-zone economic growth and said he was pleased the currency has recently moved away from near parity with the dollar. Late in European trading, the common currency of the 11-nation euro zone was at 1.0332, strengthening from 1.0302 the previous day. In late New York trading, the euro rose to 1.0317 from 1.0313 Tuesday. The ECB, as expected, left its refinancing rate unchanged at 3, where it has been since a half-percentage point rise in November. In addition to the good prospects for euro-zone growth, Mr. Duisenberg noted generous liquidity in the market and expected upward pressures on consumer prices. Although such comments could be seen as paving the way for an eventual interest-rate rise, Mr. Duisenberg stopped well short of sounding an inflation alarm. Rather, he said consumer-price increases the ECB sees for early 2000 should not give undue cause for concern. Euro-zone government bonds rose on Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which markets took as lessening the chances of a nearterm rate rise. However, European stocks generally ended lower as markets focused on the possibility rates will soon rise in the U.S.
Toys R Us Inc. said it expects to report full-year earnings well below earlier expectations, reflecting weaker-than-expected holiday sales. The retailer's shares dropped 11 on the news. The forecast for the company's fiscal year ending Jan. 29 was the latest setback in an attempted turnaround, and came after a favorable third quarter. Much of the retail world is celebrating big holiday sales, driven by a strong economy and a surging stock market. Toys R Us told analysts it was comfortable with a reduced earnings-per-share estimate of about 1.10 a share for the year, down from about 1.40. The company said it expects to post an operating loss of 20 cents a share to 25 cents a share in its Internet business for the year, also wider than earlier expectations. Toys R Us's retail Web site had trouble handling volume over the holidays, and to placate customers, it offered discounts and free shipping. Those moves contributed to the operating loss, said Louis Lipschitz, chief financial officer. For the crucial nine-week holiday season ended Jan. 1, sales in U.S. stores open at least a year fell 2 compared with the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting same-store sales to rise to the mid single-digit range. In November, Wall Street had been buoyed by the retailer's robust third quarter when comparable-store sales were up 13 in the U.S.
Mortgage rates started off 2000 by hitting their highest levels since August amid fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.15 percent for the week ending Jan. 7, up from 8.06 percent last week, according to a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac. Before late August, the last time mortgage rates were this high was April 18, 1997, when they reached 8.16 percent. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were up this week with an average rate of 7.73 percent this week, up from the average rate of 7.66 percent last week. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 6.60 percent this week, up from 6.56 percent the previous week.
The success or failure of Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad's push to dollarize his country's economy depends less on the technical details than on his ability to do something he has failed to do since taking office in August 1998 gain credibility. Late Monday evening, Ecuador's Central Bank approved Mr. Mahuad's proposal to replace Ecuador's troubled currency, the sucre, with the U.S. dollar. The president of Ecuador's Central Bank, Pablo Better, resigned in protest. Mr. Better was the only member of the Central Bank's board to oppose the measure. As Mr. Mahuad has struggled to deal with such multiple crises as widespread bank failures, a deep recession, foreign-debt defaults, rising inflation and unemployment, he has been dogged by criticism for acting too slowly and too late. His proposal to dollarize Ecuador's economy stands out as the boldest move he has made so far as president. The risk, say critics, is that Ecuadoreans and investors have lost so much faith in the beleaguered president that even this measure may not be enough to save his presidency. Mr. Mahuad's move puts Ecuador at the center of a growing and controversial movement in the developing world toward dollarization or so-called currency boards as pressures on weak currencies push countries to link them to stronger currencies. Some economists have expressed concern over the potential dangers of developing nations sacrificing control over monetary policy to the central banks of stronger, industrialized nations, whose economies have little in common with poor countries like Ecuador. Mr. Mahuad's proposal to dollarize is meant to end the currency crisis and silence growing calls for his resignation. Last week, the president declared a state of emergency to keep protests against his government from getting out of control. Yesterday, there were announcements of a new wave of protests by leaders of Ecuador's indigenous groups who were angered by the dollarization move. It's not such a bad idea, says Michael Henry, Latin America economist at ING Baring. But Mr. Mahuad has to build some credibility and break the cycle of low expectations that has plagued his government almost from the start. If this is enough to shock Ecuadorean politicians and get them to make the necessary changes in how the country's economy is run, then it's a good idea.
The voice on the telephone exuded bewilderment. I've lived a fortunate life, Donald Sterling was saying. As a trial lawyer I generated a good income. I got into real estate and, thanks to inflation and this wonderful country we live in, everything I owned went up tenfold. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends. But this basketball team of mine... Mr. Sterling didn't finish the thought because he didn't have to. Everybody knows about the Los Angeles Clippers, the basketball team he bought in 198l. The Clippers are famous for failure, a club that defies the so-called law of averages by being bad year in and year out. Other teams also do that, but not with the Clippers' obduracy. They were bad last year, when their 9-41 won-lost record was the worst in the National Basketball Association's Pacific Division, and second-worst overall. They were bad the year before, at 17-65. They've had exactly one winning season in the 17 in which Mr. Sterling has owned them, and not many more in the years before that, when he didn't. They have some good young players this season, but, as everybody knows, it takes more than good young players to win in the NBA, and their record through Wednesday was 10-24, good or bad for sixth place in their seven-team division. They've won but one playoff series in their franchise's 30-year history, in 1976, and aren't likely to add to that total this year. The Clippers have been good for a couple of things, neither of which professional-sports teams like to claim as distinctions. One is for ticket availability Even in the new Staples Center, which they and their NBA citymates, the Lakers, occupy jointly, the Clippers are averaging 6,000 empty seats a game, about the same number as they had at their former home at the old Sports Arena the Lakers generally sell out. The other is as a source of jokes. Los Angeles has everything, the comedian Arsenio Hall has remarked. If you like basketball, there's the Lakers. If you don't, there's the Clippers.
So one week after The Deal, who are the winners and losers If the stock market is any guide, one obvious winner in the announced megamerger of America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. is Time Warner itself, which obtained a stunning 70 merger premium to its then-prevailing stock price. The transaction was valued at about 160 billion when announced, but the decline in AOL's stock reduced the value to a current price of 138 billion. In some respects, that was completely expected, and the one-day delay before AOL's decline -- now standing at about 18 -- was largely driven by the early euphoria over the deal. But what also took place was a massive transfer of value from AOL shareholders to Time Warner shareholders, so a decline in AOL was inevitable, points out one media investment banker. Time Warner's shares ended up 25 for the week, a very respectable showing. Though it was precedent-setting in many respects, from a financial point of view the transaction was a typical late '90s deal a fast-growing upstart with a high-multiple stock -- WorldCom Inc., Qwest Communications International Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. -- using its currency to buy a more-established company with hard assets. Thus, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications to form MCI WorldCom Inc. and is now buying Sprint Corp., Qwest is acquiring U S West Inc., and Global Crossing acquired Frontier Corp. Those deals all deflated the multiples of the buyers. Then, later in the week Charles Schwab Corp., the online brokerage behemoth that has an Internet-like multiple compared with other financials, said it would pay 2.7 billion in stock to buy blue-blooded U.S. Trust Corp. The two seemingly dissimilar announcements underscored to Wall Street that the new and old worlds combining would likely be good news for the old-world stocks -- and for more mergers. Trust banks climbed on the news.
TORONTO -- The prospect of rising interest rates across the world's leading industrialized economies and the continued strength of the Japanese yen will be significant issues for currency markets this week. The week should begin on a quiet note as most U.S. markets close Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and currency watchers expect little change for the dollar against both the yen and the euro. At the end of the week, though, finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations gather in Tokyo. Talk of coordinated action by the world's top central banks to weaken the yen has weighed on the Japanese currency since it flirted with 100 yen to 1 late December. But most analysts believe the Tokyo G-7 summit will offer little beyond the kind of joint communique issued at the September 1999 G-7 meeting in Washington, in which finance ministers groused about the strong yen and its potential effects on the Japanese and world economies, but ruled out joint intervention to weaken it. There's a lot of rhetoric about concerted G-7 intervention, particularly in Japan, said Jeff Cheah, market strategist at Standard & Poor's MMS online service in Toronto. But we haven't seen the G-7 intervene for a long time, and I don't think dollaryen has got to a level where it's considered excessive enough to warrant intervention.
It's the mantra of investors in love with Internet stocks Yes, most dot-com companies have meager revenues and steep losses. But their levitating share prices are justified because they are blue-chip giants of tomorrow, even if it takes five or 10 years. So why do many investors who buy these stocks dump them after five or 10 days or, in the case of rapid-fire day traders, after five or 10 minutes I won't hold a 'Net stock for more than a week, says Barbara J. Simon, a big believer in the new economy who runs a stock-picking business, called Market Gems, on the Web. You don't want to get stuck in a correction. Ms. Simon, a 40-year-old former high-school teacher and graphic designer, and the 1,400 subscribers who follow her stock calls aren't the only ones playing hot potato with Internet stocks. Individual investors chatting on Internet-message boards, as well as Wall Street professionals, say they can't resist taking quick profits in tech highfliers, even though they insist they believe fervently in the companies' long-term prospects. This raises the question of what happens if the faithful lose faith. It's very paradoxical, what's going on, says Steve Galbraith, a financial-services analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. He says, So much of the current valuation is tied to out-year earnings, yet no one who's investing in these things is going to hang on to see if they make money in the out years.
Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Citigroup, said it would buy the investment-banking business of Schroders, one of Britain's biggest investment-banking firms. The 2.2 billion deal thrusts Salomon into the forefront of advising European corporations, as the number of transcontinental deals accelerates. And the deal doubles the size of Citigroup's relatively small United Kingdom investment banking operation. El Paso Energy agreed to buy Coastal Corp. for 16 billion in stock and assumed debt, expanding a natural-gas pipeline network that already is the biggest in the United States. Adding Coastal's pipelines to its own will help El Paso's plan to expand in electricity sales by making it easier to build power plants near major markets, Ronald Kuehn Jr., El Paso chairman, said in a statement. JDS Uniphase, the world's largest maker of fiber-optic equipment parts, agreed to buy E-Tek Dynamics for 15 billion in stock to alleviate shortages in capacity and make new products faster. San Jose-based E-Tek's main products are found in equipment that phone companies increasingly are using to boost the capacity of fiber- optic networks to handle the growth of Internet use. Mariner Post-Acute Network, the nation's second-largest operator of nursing homes, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, blaming federal cuts in Medicare reimbursement. The Atlanta-based company, which runs more than 400 nursing homes nationwide, said the 1997 Balanced Budget Act had cut its Medicare reimbursement by 115 per nursing-home resident. Two other large long-term care chains-- Louisville-based Vencor and Albuquerque-based Sun Healthcare Group-- have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past six months. Coca-Cola said Jack Stahl will become the beverage giant's new president and chief operating officer. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said it intended to elect Stahl, who currently leads the soft-drink maker's operations in the Americas, to his new position as second-in- command at the company's April 19 board of directors meeting.
ROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Textron Inc. reaffirmed its confidence in meeting analysts' expectations for the recently ended fourth quarter and full year. The earnings projection was issued as a number of big industrial companies, including Textron, took a beating in the stock market yesterday. The share-price drop, however, wasn't linked to any serious problems at Textron -- an aircraft, automotive, industrial and finance company -- but a general selloff in the market of older-line industrial issues, said Brian Eisenbarth, analyst for Collins & Co. in San Francisco. At the 4 p.m. close of New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Textron stood at 57.875, down 5.375, or 8.5. A First CallThomson Financial survey of 11 analysts put the mean earnings estimate for Textron at 1.11 a share for the fourth quarter and 4.04 a share for the year ended Dec. 31.
Don't count out the dinosaurs when it comes to Internet banking. In the mid-1990s, a host of Internet-only banks began popping up with promises to run circles around the big banks, weighed down by bricks, mortar and costly tellers. But now the Internet banks are being swallowed up by traditional banks and other financial-services firms or left behind in the race to sign up online customers. Big banks, despite their own struggles, are attracting far more Internet accounts than are banks with no branches that offer only an online presence. One result Investors have punished Net.Bank, the largest of the pure Internet banks. Shares of the Atlanta online bank have dived 77 from their peak in April on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Net.Bank has had a hard time getting the kind of brand recognition that a Citibank or Wells Fargo has, Robert Loest, a mutual-fund manager at IPS Advisory, of Knoxville, Tenn., said in a note to investors. He recently dumped his Net.Bank shares. It is too early to predict the ultimate winners in the online-banking game, of course. But investors now are betting that the banks that will prevail won't be Net start-ups but the old-line established companies that now have entered the fray.
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit hit another record in November, swelling to 26.50 billion on a surge of imports of foreign cars and consumer goods. The deficit in goods and services, seasonally adjusted, was 940 million more than October's revised and record 25.56 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999. But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising 557 million to 82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products. Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to 109.39 billion from October's 107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992. While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine. The buildup of precautionary inventories ahead of Y2K probably pulled in a few more exports during the fourth quarter, said Mark Vitner, economist with First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. The continued strength in the U.S. economy, however, is the most important reason imports remain so strong.
Blue-chip stocks fell steeply amid worries that rising interest rates will ultimately cut into corporate earnings, while signs of strong growth from leading technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further into record territory. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.06 to close at 11,351.30. The Dow pitched wildly during the session, rising as much as 68 points early and plunging as much as 214 at midday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.22, to 4189.51, extending the record high reached the day before. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.33, to 1445.57. Stocks rose at the opening bell after IBM, which sent a chill through the technology sector last fall when it said sales had slumped because of worries about year 2000 computer problems, easily beat Wall Street's profit forecasts. Alcoa dropped 4 58, to 73 12, as the company announced plans to restart primary aluminum production to meet growing global demand. The announcement sparked fears that aluminum prices will drop, hurting Alcoa's bottom line. A steady rise in aluminum prices last year helped Alcoa turn in the highest returns of any Dow component stock.
Newly installed President Gustavo Noboa named some members of his cabinet today as his government began trying to restore public confidence in the political system of a country that has had six presidents since 1996. Noboa became president of this small South American country Saturday after Jamil Mahuad was ousted following week-long protests by thousands of Indians that culminated in their taking over the Congress and Supreme Court buildings on Friday. After the takeovers, a three-man junta was formed, only to fall apart when the army general on the team dissolved it, following pressure from the United States and other countries. Congress then quickly voted Vice President Noboa into the presidency, leaving him to try to calm a population that is bowed under the country's worst economic crisis in decades and is profoundly cynical about government's ability to do anything about it. In brief comments to reporters today, Noboa said his top priority was to establish a government with great transparency and honesty. Everyone should know that I will fight corruption.
WASHINGTON -- Reaffirming its landmark 1976 campaign-finance decision, the Supreme Court ruled that states may impose limits on campaign contributions to candidates for statewide office. In a 6-3 decision, the justices said a Missouri law that capped contributions to statewide candidates at different levels, with an inflation adjustment, didn't violate free-speech rights. The law was challenged in 1998 by a small political-action group, Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The law was upheld by a U.S. district court in Missouri but overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The decision was announced yesterday, as Iowans prepared to vote in their state's caucuses in the kickoff of the 2000 campaign season. The timing highlighted the growing public disgust with the huge amount of money needed to mount a campaign and the amount of influence -- and sometimes corruption -- that such contributions often bring. As a result, both advocates and critics of campaign-finance laws had been interested in whether the high court would use the Missouri case to redraw the landscape created by its 1976 decision, Buckley vs. Valeo. At that time, the justices ruled that the Constitution permitted limits on campaign contributions but not on campaign spending. The current limit on contributions by individuals in federal elections is 1,000, slightly below the upper limit of 1,075 in the Missouri case. Writing for the majority, Justice David Souter addressed the corruption issue, which was the prime justification for the Missouri law. There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption on our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.
Stocks plunged today as optimism about corporate earnings gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their impact on profit growth. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 243.54 points to close at 11,008.17, its biggest loss since Jan. 4, when it fell 359 points. The sell-off was broad-based, with 27 of 30 Dow component stocks finishing lower. General Electric, down 6 at 138 18, and Johnson & Johnson, down 6-316 at 83-1116, led the decline. Broader stock indicators also fell in a volatile session. The Nasdaq plummeted 139.32 points to close at 4096.08, its worst point drop since it fell 150 points on Jan. 5, and its fourth-biggest point decline ever. The Nasdaq had risen 67 points in early trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock average fell 39.45, to 1401.91, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell for the first time since Jan. 12, dropping 10.99, to 522.95. After a strong opening, stocks began to slide at midday as investors looked ahead to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1-2. Many people on Wall Street now fear that an interest rate increase at that meeting will be the first of several this year as the central bank works to stave off inflation.
WASHINGTON -- With unemployment continuing to fall and the economic boom nearing a record as the longest in U.S. history, consumers began the new year with confidence in the economy soaring to an all-time high. The Conference Board's monthly index measuring the economic outlook of U.S. households jumped three points in January, to 144.7 from 141.7 in December, and now stands at the highest level in the survey's 32-year history. The increase is the fourth straight monthly rise for the index, which has more than recovered from a slump in the summer and fall. This is an astonishingly strong report, Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., told his clients. The survey, considered a good predictor of consumer demand, offers further evidence that consumer spending is likely to remain strong into the immediate future. With jobs remaining plentiful, economists said consumers weren't fazed by recent stock-market volatility, rising mortgage rates or surging energy prices. An expanding global economy and a robust job market suggest that consumer optimism and consumer spending could rise even further, said Lynn Franco, the economist who oversees the survey of 5,000 households for the New York-based private research firm.
We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly. As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process. Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy heats up.  The Fed Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued price stability and has raised interest rates as in 1994 to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.  Better Management Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons the recession foreign competition deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries hostile corporate takeovers the growth of new discounters Wal-Mart, Home Depot. Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and downsizings became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and as with Volcker's recession widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.  New Technology As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise productivity. Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s.
NEW YORK -- The board of the National Association of Securities Dealers approved a pilot program that would extend to investors the same sort of price protection in thinly traded stocks that they have had for several years on the more heavily traded Nasdaq stocks. The program will require market makers -- who quote prices at which they trade with investors -- on the NASD's OTC Bulletin Board to execute customer limit orders before their own. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock within the customer's prescribed price limit. The Bulletin Board, unlike the NASD's Nasdaq Stock Market, isn't an electronic stock forum but rather a quotation system whose securities are traded manually by and through market makers. Rules giving priority to customer limit orders on Nasdaq have been in place since early 1997, after the stock market came under scrutiny for price fixing. The 12-month program, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is part of a continuing effort by the NASD to make more-stringent rules for the Bulletin Board, home to small and infrequently traded stocks with a reputation for being more easily manipulated than those on mainstream stock markets.
Holman W. Jenkins Jr. Business World, Jan. 19 posed the question, What exactly is the purpose of the federal makework project known as the public audit The answer is that an audit provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements are not materially misstated. Audits make financial information more reliable by reducing the frequency and magnitude of errors and fraud. Controversy arises over how much assurance auditors should provide at a reasonable cost. Victims of fraud argue that every fraud should have been detected. Auditors argue that providing absolute assurance against fraud would make audits prohibitively expensive. Although the SEC requires public corporations to have their financial statements audited, it is a mistake to think that audits occur only by government mandate or that audits have no economic value. In 1926, prior to any government requirements, 79 of the corporations listed on the NYSE published audited financial statements. They did so because investors and creditors demanded an auditor's assurance before entrusting the corporations with their money. Today, hundreds of not-for-profit organizations and private businesses voluntarily hire auditors. Research shows that private businesses with audited financial statements pay lower interest rates on their commercial bank loans than do similar private businesses whose financial statements are not audited. Evidently, lenders value the assurance provided by an auditor's report. Thousands of CPAs employed in small accounting firms are proud to provide audit services to their clients. Unfortunately, many in the Big 5 appear to share Mr. Jenkins's view that audits are unnecessary compliance exercises. The large firms seem ashamed of their accounting heritage and now call themselves professional service organizations. The problem is not that audits have no value. The problem is that too many large firm partners are more concerned about making money than with upholding professional standards. Paul M. Clikeman, Ph.D., CPA Assistant Professor of Accounting
Stocks struggled to a mixed finish after the Federal Reserve's widely expected interest-rate increase did little to calm turbulent U.S. financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 to close at 11,003.20. The blue-chip index rose as much as 60 points in the moments before the Fed released its decision, then bobbed between positive and negative territory for much of the rest of the session. The Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 0.16, to 1409.12, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 21.98, to 4073.96. Stocks gave up early gains after the Fed said it was raising its target for the federal funds rate--the interest banks charge one another on overnight loans--to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent. Several commercial banks quickly announced that they, too, would boost borrowing costs. Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by making it more difficult for companies to borrow money to finance growth.
The mortgage broker called out of the blue a year ago, but Jaquetta Patrick liked what he was selling. The 62-year-old retired secretary for the D.C. school system, who is legally blind, recalls that he said he could get her a much better deal than the 56,000, 15-year, 10.99 percent loan she had at the time. He said he could get her an interest rate under 7 percent and told her to stop paying her mortgage because he would take care of that until the new loan came through, according to court papers. Several months and a confusing array of mortgage brokers later, the District resident ended up with a 30-year loan for 65,800 carrying a rate that varies from 11.49 percent to 18.49 percent. When she asked why the rate was so much higher than what she had been paying, she says, she was told it was because she had a bad credit record, brought on by her failure to pay her mortgage for the past three months--as the broker had instructed. Patrick says she signed the papers for the new loan out of fear she would lose her house. They have danced me around so much I don't even know who's who anymore, she said. I'm devastated. There's an uneasy revolution going in consumer finance--subprime lending. Over the past five years many banks have rushed headlong into this market, defined as extending credit to consumers whose troubled credit histories make them a higher risk. The lure, despite the higher risk, has been potentially higher profit margins than lending to top-notch, prime credits, said Thomas Abruzzo, bank analyst at FitchIBCA, a credit-rating agency headquartered in New York.
WASHINGTON -- Even as he trumpeted his plan to pay off the national debt by 2013, President Clinton quietly suggested an increase in the legal ceiling on how much debt the government can hold. Why The answer lies in the difference between the debt held by the public and the total debt that the Treasury owes, which includes long-term obligations to other government agencies -- notably the Social Security trust fund -- for future benefits. Many economists consider the public debt, which the White House projects will decline to zero in 2013 from 3.48 trillion in the current fiscal year, to be the most important. That is what affects interest rates and the government's immediate impact on the broader economy. Mr. Clinton uses that measure when he talks of cutting up the government's credit card. But some analysts and politicians consider total government debt a better measure of the government's long-term responsibilities, and that figure rises as aging baby boomers stake an ever-bigger claim on Social Security benefits. Congressional limits on federal borrowing apply to that figure, not just publicly held debt. The current statutory debt limit is 5.95 trillion. For the current fiscal year, the debt subject to that limit will be safely below that figure -- about 5.65 trillion. But under the Clinton plan, government debt would cross the ceiling by hitting 6 trillion in 2004 and 6.79 trillion in 2013.
Stocks today diverged in familiar fashion, with technology shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a sixth straight session while blue-chip industrials slumped. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01, to 10,905.79, and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 0.13, to 1424.24. The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen nearly 6 percent so far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5 percent. It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why, said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. General Electric, down 5-116 at 136 12, and Boeing, down 2-316 at 41-1316, contributed most to the Dow's decline.
NEW YORK -- Price swings and odd price movements returned to the bond market after two days of relative normalcy, as investors scrambled to buy longterm Treasurys and traders sought to reverse so-called hedges, pushing longterm Treasury prices higher. In late trading, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 1 1332, or 14.0625 for a bond with a 1,000 face value, at 98 1532. The bond's yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 6.230 from 6.337. But 10-year Treasury notes, quickly becoming the benchmark of the bond market, rose just 532 to yield 6.609. And two-year Treasurys were unchanged, yielding 6.665. Investors and traders who sold short Treasurys in recent months, or borrowed and sold these securities as part of a hedging strategy aimed at protecting other bond investments, scrambled to buy back Treasurys yesterday, traders said, forcing prices higher. There's more dislocation in the market as more hedges are unwound, or reversed, said Scott Graham co-head of government-bond trading at Prudential Securities. It will take more than a few days to get through it all.
Cisco Systems, which makes Internet equipment, said fiscal second- quarter net income rose to 825 million from 282 million as revenue rose 53 percent. Excluding acquisition expenses, its profit was 906 million, or 25 cents, a penny better than analysts expected, compared with 609 million, or 17 cents. The company also set a 2-for-1 stock split, payable in March. Bank of New York agreed to provide information about its customers to Federal Reserve regulators in the wake of an examination into fund transfers from Russia. The bank agreed to report quarterly to the New York Fed Bank and state regulators about transactions of customers it has identified as potential money-launderers. The bank said it would devise a plan within 45 days to identify those customers involved in known or suspected criminal activity against the bank. Nokia Oyj extended its lead as the world's biggest maker of cellular phones, boosting global market share to 26.9 percent last year from 22.5 percent, according to Gartner Group's Dataquest unit. Motorola and Ericsson held on to the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively, but Motorola's share slipped to 16.9 percent from 19.5 percent, while Ericsson's share dropped to 10.5 percent from 15.1 percent. Europe had the biggest percentage of mobile phone sales, and Asia-Pacific beat the United States for the No. 2 spot. Sales in Latin America doubled. Five large hedge funds released a report offering recommendations on risk management and business practices for the industry, in response to Long-Term Capital Management's near-collapse in 1998 after it lost 4 billion. The report was prepared by Soros Fund Management, Caxton, Kingdon Capital Management, Moore Capital Management and Tudor Investment, each of which manage more than 3 billion. Raytheon, the third-largest U.S. defense company, plans to sell 500 million of its businesses this year as it trims debt and focuses on more profitable units, the company told analysts and investors at a conference in New York.
NEW YORK -- Stocks ended more than a week of divergence by falling in unison. High-tech stocks, one of the few sectors to hold up in recent trading, lost ground, as investors took profits in high-priced issues. That halted a streak of seven straight gains by the Nasdaq Composite Index. Blue-chip issues such as Microsoft lost 5 1516 to 104, while Intel, coming off a 52-week high Tuesday, declined 4 316 to 104 58 both on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Motorola declined 6 1316 to 153 916. Meanwhile, several of the momentum-driven high-tech issues that had persisted in the face of a broad decline in recent sessions got caught in the sell-off. Yahoo fell 10 1316 to 362 516, while Commerce One eased 9 34 to 155 38, and Conexant Systems, also coming off a 52-week high, fell 7 to 104 1516, all on Nasdaq. Some technology issues managed to gain. Juniper Networks rose 16 516 to 185 1516, and Vitesse Semiconductor climbed 5 1316 to 55 1316, both on Nasdaq. Sun Microsystems Nasdaq, after an upbeat research note from Bear Stearns, gained 4 916 to 91 916. Nortel Networks advanced 1 34 to 122. Rival Lucent Technologies fell 1 18 to 53.
Shares of Diversa Corp. soared in their first day of trading, rising to more than triple their 24-a-share initial public offering price. The San Diego biotechnology company said it raised about 200 million in gross proceeds from the stock sale, before expenses. The shares opened yesterday at 56 on the Nasdaq Stock Market and rose to a high of 79.375 before falling back to 75 at 4 p.m. Diversa said it sold about 8.3 million shares, including the exercise of options to cover underwriters' overallotments. More than 14 million shares changed hands during the trading day. Diversa is an early-stage biotechnology company that is developing novel enzymes from diverse natural environments and then screening them for possible use in agricultural, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. The company said it has collected samples from such places as Costa Rica, Indonesia, Iceland, and Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. Our processes are designed to help our strategic partners and customers reduce cost, reduce waste, improve yield and enhance the quality of end products and manufacturing, Diversa said in its prospectus filed in December with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's first product, Pyrolase 160, is used in the energy industry to facilitate oil recovery. Diversa is also hoping to discover compounds that may be used to develop human drugs. Diversa's strategic partners, which have been a significant source of funding, include units of Novartis AG, Dow Chemical Co. and Rhone-Poulenc SA. In addition to 9.5 million received through Sept. 30, 1999, Diversa's partners are committed to fund at least 69.1 million under existing agreements, according to the prospectus.
Correction What correction The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 198.25 points, or 1.88, to 10718.09, on top of a 94.63 gain Monday. The Dow has now recovered in two days all of Friday's 218.42-point loss and more. At Friday's close, the industrials were down 11 from their Jan. 14 high, in what Wall Street calls a correction, or a drop of at least 10. Now the surging blue chips are down just 8.6 from that high. Beaten-down old-industry stocks such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing again led the gains, along with financial stocks such as American Express. Big technology stocks also staged a recovery, but last year's tech highfliers, such as Qualcomm and JDS Uniphase, didn't keep pace. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose a marginal 0.05, or 2.22 points, to 4420.77. But that small gain was the product of a huge afternoon recovery the tech-led Nasdaq had been down as much as 127.45 in the morning and recovered all of its losses before trading ended. Bonds fell, and the dollar was mixed.
Stocks were mixed in volatile trading as blue-chip issues, falling victim once again to investor worries about interest rates, ended a two-day rally. Technology stocks managed a slim advance. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 156.68 to close at 10,561.41, wiping out more than half of the past two sessions' 292- point gain. Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock fell index 14.38, to 1387.67, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88, to 4427.65. American Express led the Dow lower, tumbling 5-932, to 153-27 32, as investors guessed it would be among the stocks to suffer if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In an effort to keep inflation under control, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June. The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all, said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. in New York. Stocks continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is taking a harder line on the perils of rapid growth, signaling that the Fed will keep raising interest rates unless consumer spending and the stock market quickly cool down. In his semiannual economic presentation to Congress, Mr. Greenspan dropped his assertion -- made a month ago -- that the Fed's attempts to rein in the economy with earlier interest-rate increases were well advanced. Instead, he said yesterday that investor optimism and a bullish stock market have to date . . . more than offset the effects of higher rates and that spending even in sectors of the economy normally considered sensitive to higher rates has remained robust. There is, he said, little evidence that the American economy . . . is slowing appreciably. In a booklet presented to the House Banking Committee accompanying Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Fed staffers wrote that the continued surge in demand implies that the level of interest rates needed to align demand with potential supply may have increased substantially. Markets have long been expecting the Fed to boost its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- by at least a quarter of a percentage point when policymakers next meet on March 21. Many investors have been expecting at least another half-point increase by the summer.
NEW YORK -- Investors and traders are looking forward to a quieter week in the Treasurys market. But few are willing to bet they will get one. There won't be much market-moving economic data, but here is what could go wrong anyway Investors might turn a cold shoulder to tomorrow's Treasury two-year note auction, causing the entire market to sell off. More companies could tap the corporate debt market, possibly siphoning money away from Treasurys and causing price gyrations. Bearishness about Federal Reserve policy could increase, especially after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan resumes his testimony to Congress tomorrow.
Blue-chip stocks broke a three-day losing streak in a volatile day on Wall Street as investors looked for bargains and shunned usually hot technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down as much as 115 points early in the day, rallied in the afternoon to close up 85.32 at 10,304.84. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake off concerns about interest rates and fell 29.62, to 4382.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.08, to 1352.17. Today's performance was a marked change from the recent trend on Wall Street that has pushed the Nasdaq up more than 8 percent this year and the Dow down 11 percent. What you are really seeing today is what has been oversold, the Dow, is coming back. And what was overbought, the Nasdaq, is having a correction, said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in Chicago.
Some key Persian Gulf oil ministers hinted that they back production increases to ease high oil prices, but they carefully avoided specifics about how much and when. Meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council said they hoped to maintain the market stability . . . for the interests of producers and consumers without harming the world economy. The council comprises Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of oil Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. The meeting comes as concern about higher oil prices is intensifying. The price for West Texas Intermediate crude now hovers around 29 a barrel, and inventories are unusually low. The supply tightness has pushed prices high enough that major consuming nations, notably the U.S., are beginning to worry about its impact on inflation and their economies. UAE oil minister Obaid bin Said al-Nasseri told his country's official news agency WAM that oil prices in a range of 20 a barrel to 25 a barrel would be an acceptable level for both consumers and producers. An identical range was mentioned by Mr. Naimi a few days ago on a trip to South Korea, according to Korean officials. That would imply some increase in supplies when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets March 27 in Vienna, unless demand suddenly slackens for seasonal or other reasons.
The spotlight in Europe's new-issue stock market is focused almost exclusively on telecommunications-industry offerings, as investors battle for the growing numbers of newly public enterprises. Zurich-based Carrier1 International SA became the latest beneficiary of the fervor for telecommunications stocks yesterday, as investors in both Europe and the U.S. fought for a piece of the company's initial public offering. Even after both the size and the price range of the IPO were boosted by the underwriters -- led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney -- the issue was still about 30 times oversubscribed. The IPO of 9.375 million shares was priced at 87 euros a share 87.27 raising 818.2 million and giving the company a stock-market value of roughly 3.5 billion. The shares priced above the range at which they had been marketed, which already had been boosted from the initial range of between 65 and 75 each. Underwriters have the option to sell an additional 1.4 million shares to help meet the excess demand. The company, which is less than two years old, will begin trading today on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and Germany's Neuer Markt, the growth-stock division of the Deutsche Boerse. About a third of the shares were sold to U.S. investors and the remaining two-thirds sold in Europe. Carrier1 is just the latest example of how telecommunications companies dominate the financing landscape in Europe. Carrier1 is building a European fiber-optic network.
Extraordinary affluence is obviously changing the nation's political agenda. Less obviously, and ominously, it is changing the nation's political sensibility, reducing to the vanishing point the once-sturdy concern for limited government. The nation's freedom and prosperity have been secured. The problems that dominate day-to-day legislative business--e.g., reducing pollution and congestion, improving medical care, providing more police--are not resource problems The sacrifices involved in paying for such things are not prohibitive. Christopher DeMuth, head of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that although Americans are unprecedentedly prosperous, self-sufficient and at peace with one another, government continues to grow prodigiously because of little- understood dynamics. Government outlays federal, state, local and regulatory costs-- largely imposed on the private sector--have grown more than 50 percent faster than the economy for 50 years and now claim more than one-third of GDP. The federal government owns one-third of all land, pays for 40 percent of medical care, manages nearly 50 percent of individuals' retirement funds and regulates many industries. Most Americans live and work in a web of government rules. Forces working to inhibit government include globalization--the ability of capital and services to move to hospitable locales--and technological change. For a quarter-century, says DeMuth, the government has been trying and largely failing to regulate the computer industry Although it may lasso an individual firm such as Microsoft, it has no hope of corralling the entire industry as it did trucking and railroads in an earlier age. However, more private wealth means more resources for the traditional lobbying of government, and more incentives for government to try something new. It is what DeMuth calls the New Executive State expanding through extortion.
President Clinton, in a wide-ranging defense of his economic policy, urged the nation today to continue shrinking the federal debt and seeking new trade opportunities to keep the economy strong. In what the White House billed as a major economic speech, the president rejected criticisms of his fiscal strategy--which has largely focused on deficit reduction--from the political left and right. Noting that some liberals want him to spend more heavily on social issues and some conservatives want deeper tax cuts, Clinton said, You can't forget what got you here. Clinton said the government also must continue to encourage the growth of information technologies and to close the digital divide that keeps many from sharing the benefits of computerization and the Internet. And he renewed his call for China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which some labor and environmental groups oppose. The federal debt reduction that has occurred under his watch set in motion a virtuous cycle that lowered interest rates and made it easier for businesses to expand and for families to pay off loans for cars, houses and college educations, Clinton told an audience at the University of Pennsylvania. His 44-minute address was the first in an annual lecture series founded by entrepreneur and Clinton political supporter Michael Granoff. The president said he will convene a major White House conference on the economy on April 5. It will include several economists, corporate executives and others to focus on the most cutting-edge issues facing the new economy, an administration briefing paper said.
The first thing is to keep wishing really hard that the energized U.S. economy keeps on going and going and going. Baltimore, for example, began a long downward slide in 1990 that was accelerated by a devastating recession that infected its manufacturing, real estate and financial services industries. But now, the nation's recovery has gone on long enough that its benefits have spread even to hard-hit urban cores like Baltimore's, or the District's. Employment in Baltimore peaked at 470,900 in March of 1980. Eight years later, it had plunged to around 395,000, or a net loss of more than 75,000 jobs, based on monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. The job shrinkage continued even after the U.S. and Maryland economies turned upward as the city's rising crime and drug problems and deteriorating schools chased families and employers away. But in the past year, Baltimore has enjoyed a small renaissance. Employment in the last three months of 1999 averaged around 417,000-- a gain of more than 4 percent from the previous year's low point.
TeleCorp PCS Inc., a wireless-phone company that builds and operates networks in affiliation with AT&T Corp., said it will acquire the wireless-phone company Tritel Inc. for about 5.3 billion in stock. TeleCorp, based in Arlington, Va., is the largest affiliate of AT&T's big wireless-services unit. National wireless operators such as AT&T, Sprint Corp.'s Sprint PCS business and Nextel Communications Inc. often work with smaller companies such as TeleCorp and Tritel to fill holes in their national footprints. In the case of TeleCorp and Tritel, Jackson, Miss., the companies operate wireless networks in certain markets, and both co-brand their service with AT&T. AT&T holds minority equity stakes in both companies. Indeed, the deal adds heft to AT&T's wireless network, consolidating two of its largest affiliates and accelerating the growth of its wireless network. It also strengthens TeleCorp's position in the fastgrowing affiliate niche, creating a wireless company with licenses that will cover some 35 million potential subscribers from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. This puts together the middle of the country. said Gerald Vento, CEO of TeleCorp. We can effectively operate in a competitive market with a larger footprint.
WASHINGTON -- Reversing a recent trend, consumers' incomes rose faster than their spending in January. But Americans are still reaching for their wallets more than Federal Reserve decision makers would like. Personal income jumped 0.7 last month while consumer spending rose 0.5, the Commerce Department said. Adjusted for inflation, core consumer spending inched up just 0.3. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was unchanged at 0.2. The savings rate bounced back to 1.4 after hitting a record low of 1 in December. The numbers, which suggest Americans are thinking twice about some purchases, represent an about-face from December when personal income grew just 0.3 and consumer spending surged a revised 1.1. Core consumer spending climbed 0.9. The increase in personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, was boosted by pay increases for federal civilian and military personnel, agricultural subsidies, and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Excluding the special factors, such as a 1.3 rise in government wage expenditures, the largest monthly gain since January 1993, income would have advanced 0.6. Still, consumer spending, an important driver of the nation's economy, shows few real signs that it's easing up. If January's gain in core spending repeats itself in February and March, spending in the first quarter would increase at a 5.8 annual rate, a hair under the robust 5.9 pace recorded at the end of last year.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as the market largely ignored signs of continued strength in manufacturing and instead looked ahead to tomorrow's monthly update on labor-market growth. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 932 point, or 2.8125 for a bond with 1,000 face value, to 101 632. Its yield rose to 6.153 from 6.133 late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. But shorter maturities ended higher. Prices of 10-year notes gained 632, for example. The divergence stemmed from sales of 30-year bonds and purchases of other maturities -- so-called curve trades -- driven by wagers on how the market will be affected by the Treasury Department's planned buybacks of debt securities. Dealers decided it was the trade of the day, said Vinnie Verterano, director of government trading at Nomura Securities in New York. Among economic reports during the session, the National Association of Purchasing Management's February business index -- a broad gauge of manufacturing-sector activity -- rose to 56.9 in February from 56.3 in January. A figure above 50 suggests an expansion of activity. An index in the NAPM report that tracks prices paid by manufacturers jumped to 74.1 from 72.6, indicating a substantial rise in price pressures during the month.
OTAVALO, Ecuador -- The long black braid, the blinding white cotton trousers and the woven shoes of the local businessmen here are visible reminders of this community's tenacious cultural pride. But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S. Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors. Ergo, instead of the stereotypical Indian poverty and isolation, the dignified Otavaleno is renowned for his independence and worldliness. There is one thing, however, that Otavalenos share with this country's other Indian groups, mestizos and Europeans profound economic suffering at the hands of the perniciously politicized Ecuadoran central bank. Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80 of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6 in dollar terms. Inflation, which in 1999 was more than 60, is forecast to reach 90 in 2000. Things are so bad here that even Ecuador's politicians, notorious fans of the central bank as an inexhaustible source of generosity, have caught on. This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans. Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest. Prying their hands off the economy and moving toward liberalization will mean a long, hard fight, well beyond the simple dollar-for-sucres exchange.
Stocks bounded higher today, giving the Dow industrials their best week since July, after the government delivered a sign that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases might finally be slowing the economy. The rally was sparked by a Labor Department report that showed some easing of the tight labor market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 202.28, to 10,367.20. For the week, the blue-chip index rose 505.08 points, its best performance since the week ended July 2, 1999, when it rose 586.68. The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, surpassed 4900 for the first time and closed at a new high. The index rose 160.28 to 4914.79, well above the previous record of 4784.08, set Wednesday. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.84, to 597.88, a new record. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.41, to 1409.17.
Average together absolute euphoria and dreary disappointment and what do you get The 2.97 advance of the average stock mutual fund in the first two months of this year. Behind that small gain, as calculated by Lipper Inc., lies a huge disparity in results Some conservative stock funds favoring seemingly cheap value stocks tumbled 15 or more over the course of January and February, following a rough 1999. Meanwhile, growth funds that invest in the stocks of the fastest-growing companies continued to soar, with some gaining 40, 50 or more in a mere 60 days. Indeed, at a time when investors are still agog over the triple-digit returns posted last year by more than 175 funds, a few funds that specialize in the recently red-hot biotechnology sector broke the 100 barrier in just the first two months of this year. Those triple-digit gainers include specialized healthbiotech offerings from the Orbitex, Nicholas-Applegate and Dresdner RCM fund families. The stock market's split personality comes to life in the voices of mutual-fund managers at the two ends of the performance spectrum. It's been a wild year, exults Kurt von Emster, manager of the 1.5 billion-in-assets Franklin Biotechnology Discovery Fund, up 86.4 in January and February after a nearly triple-digit 97.9 gain in 1999. Like I tell my wife every morning, it's fun to come into work now. Fun certainly isn't the way Tony Maramarco describes his labor as manager of the bargain-hunting Babson Value Fund, which posted a 17.4 negative return for January and February after rising a bare 1.1 last year. Mr. Maramarco quotes market strategist Thomas Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette as declaring that value investing has been utterly abandoned in the marketplace. That's the feeling we get, the Babson manager says.
CHICAGO -- Bank One Corp., whose credit-card business has been hurt by rising interest rates, warned investors that first-quarter profit would likely fall shy of analysts' projections. A First CallThomson Financial poll of 14 analysts showed a median estimate of 65 cents a diluted share, with a range of 62 cents to 69 cents. We would expect and encourage the consensus to settle at the 60-cent level, said Bank One's president and acting chief executive, Verne Istock. With about 1.1 billion diluted shares outstanding, 60 cents would equal about 660 million of net income for the quarter ending March 31. A year ago, the banking concern posted net of 1.15 billion, or 88 cents a share. The disclosure sent Bank One shares down 1.1875, or 4.5, to 25 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. Friday. Mr. Istock said the first quarter would be the year's weakest. Rates that banks pay for deposits and other funds they lend have risen in recent months. But in the hotly competitive credit-card market, it is difficult to raise loan rates because many borrowers can easily jump to lower-rate cards offered through directmail solicitations.
National Association of Securities Dealers Chairman Frank Zarb asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay the start of decimal stock prices until the first quarter of next year. The SEC has ordered a phase-in of decimals on U.S. securities markets between July and October. We believe the shift to begin trading in decimals this year would impose unacceptable risks, Zarb said in a letter to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. An SEC spokesman declined comment. The Department of Agriculture will announce today that it is lifting restrictions on how much soy, diary and vegetable protein can be included in the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs. Currently, food service professionals working in schools only can include up to 30 percent of soy or other proteins in the meat, poultry or seafood served to children. Regulators said they wanted to give menu planners more flexibility in menu planning and lower the fat content of foods. Productivity grew at the fastest pace in seven years in the fourth quarter of 1999, and labor costs fell for the second straight quarter, the Labor Department said. Productivity, a gauge of output per hour worked, rose at a 6.4 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year. Unit labor costs, a barometer of underlying inflation pressures, fell at a bigger-than-expected 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the steepest drop in seven years. BP Amoco wants to swap Atlantic Richfield's Alaskan oil fields for similar assets elsewhere to overcome federal antitrust objections to its proposed 32.5 billion purchase of Arco, people familiar with the situation said. Chevron and Royal DutchShell have large fields in West Africa that BP Amoco would want, said Fadel Gheit, research director at Fahnestock. RCN's Starpower Internet services, which were out for about 33 hours on Sunday and Monday, were supposed to be back online yesterday, but more than a few of its half-million subscribers still couldn't couldn't log on. Tony Pedutto, general manager for Starpower, formerly Erols, blamed jammed phone lines due to increased traffic from people who couldn't get their e-mail over the weekend. He also said some customers who did manage to get on to the service weren't able to reach popular sites such as Yahoo Mail and ESPN because of network problems. Pedutto said the problems when they are being reported are being fixed.
The average stock trader can't figure out a way to convert stock prices like 9-1116 into dollars and cents--and, apparently, neither can the Nasdaq stock market. At least not by July 3. So Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. is going to give them another month to look at their math and submit a plan for converting from fractions to decimals. The SEC gave the nation's equities markets until April 14 to agree on a plan. The original deadline was to be Monday. But regulators did not change the July 3 target date for the markets to actually start using the penny quotations. Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns the market, said in a letter to the SEC this week that the Nasdaq would not be ready to implement decimals until 2001 because of the explosion of transactions in the technology-heavy market. In the past year, the number of daily transactions on the Nasdaq has more than doubled to a high of 2 billion, while the number of quote updates has tripled to a record 4.95 million.
After lying low for a couple of decades, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is back with a vengeance. The cartel has rediscovered its economic muscle and driven up oil prices to more than 30 a barrel. Democrats and Republicans alike are demanding that government bring down prices. But before we dust off the policy playbook of the Carter era, we should recall some lessons learned. First, begging OPEC heads of state to increase production -- as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is now doing -- is a waste of time. Production decisions are determined by financial considerations. Nothing will change that. Trying to convince OPEC that it's in the cartel's best interest to head off a global recession -- thus, that it should increase oil production -- is naive. OPEC members are almost entirely dependent on the oil trade. So long as oil profits remain robust, global recession need not concern them. The recessions of 1974 and 1979 demonstrated that OPEC can make a lot of money during hard times. Second, investigating big oil for price gouging is counterproductive. In the 1970s those suspicions were stoked by stories of oil tankers lingering offshore, supposedly waiting for prices to go up before they unloaded their cargo. Tankers were indeed lingering, but it was because docks were overloaded and ships had to wait to unload. Big oil -- then and now -- is guilty only of passing on its increased costs to consumers instead of selling at a loss. Political saber rattling about alleged corporate profiteering makes the crisis worse. The only hedge against supply disruptions in the near term is inventories. But inventories are costly to maintain. If companies can't cash them out at a profit during price spikes because they fear criminal investigation or the imposition of windfall-profit taxes, they won't bother maintaining inventories. Ironically, that is the upshot of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Politicians, alarmed that oil companies don't keep stockpiles, decided that the government must do so. Yet the existence of the reserve makes it certain that companies won't stockpile. Oil companies don't know if or when government might flood the market, dropping prices and preventing them from profiting from their inventories.
Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan today is to propose spending almost 100 million more on public education over the next year, focusing much of the increase and other resources on helping the county's most vulnerable children do better in the classroom. The proposal is part of Duncan's budget for the coming fiscal year, a 2.6 billion plan that represents an 8.2 percent increase over current spending. Duncan D is not proposing any tax cuts at a time of large budget surpluses. But his education plan would restore the county's contribution to public schools, as measured by per-pupil spending adjusted for inflation, to the level it reached before recession struck in 1991. The spending plan underscores the influence new School Superintendent Jerry D. Weast had in shaping the county budget, which gives the school system virtually its entire request. Duncan is scheduled to present the budget today during a noon news conference at Twinbrook Elementary School in Rockville. The size of the spending increase for education can be attributed partly to a school system plan to keep better track of spending and hold teachers more accountable. Duncan had criticized the school system for not having such a plan in place. The increase also comes as a strong economy generates windfalls for local governments, and many regional school systems are benefiting. Fairfax County officials recently proposed a 7 percent increase in the public schools budget. In the District, Mayor Anthony A. Williams D has proposed a 5 billion budget that includes an 80 million increase for education.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, pushing forward with its proposed plan to sell off part of the Nasdaq Stock Market, set April 14 as the date for a membership meeting to vote on the plan and mailed out proxy materials to its 5,500 member firms. The NASD also opened the process by which qualified potential investors can ask for shares in Nasdaq as part of the offering, which is expected to raise roughly 1 billion. The NASD's plan would sell Nasdaq to its members, market-making firms, listed companies and others in a two-step private-placement transaction. The first step would bring the NASD's stake in Nasdaq down to between 47 and 49, while the second step would reduce that stake further, to around 22. In order for the transaction to go into effect, its first phase requires an affirmative vote by a majority of the firms voting, while the second phase has a higher bar, requiring an approval by a majority of all members. NASD Chairman Frank Zarb, who hosted several live town-hall meetings late last year while the plan was being put together, says he will preside over a series of conference calls with members to go over the materials in the private-placement memorandum and answer questions. In an interview, he said six such meetings already are planned, with the first an all-member call planned for tomorrow.
I2 Technologies Inc. expects the acquisitions of Aspect Development Inc. and Supplybase Inc. to have a neutral effect on its operating profit this year and to add to profitability next year. The Dallas developer of business software agreed to buy Aspect Development, Mountain View, Calif., for 44.9 million shares, or about 105 a share. The purchase is valued at 8.6 billion based on the 191.1875 price of i2's stock at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Shares in i2 were down 16.8125, or 8, amid a broad technology-sector decline. Aspect was up 11.8125, or 14, to 96.8125, also on the Nasdaq. The deal is the largest to date in the software industry and combines i2's software and skills in Web-based marketplaces with Aspect's electronic catalogs that list parts and products of several thousand manufacturers. Separately, i2 said it will pay 1.8 million shares, or 344 million, for Supplybase, a closely held San Francisco company developing supply-chain software that works on the Internet. I2 bought the companies to bolster its menu of electronic-commerce software and services. A pioneer of software used by manufacturers to improve planning, factory scheduling and shipping, i2 has been moving aggressively to put its products at the center of Web-based marketplaces.
The New York Stock Exchange, already facing pressure to modernize its trading operations, is about to get a major, fully electronic competitor. The Archipelago trading system and the Pacific Exchange announced they are creating a new stock market. The alliance marks the first time one of the new alternative trading systems, known as ECNs, will effectively share a membership card as a traditional stock exchange. By joining with the Pacific, Archipelago would instantly acquire the status necessary to compete with the NYSE on a level playing field. Under the alliance, Archipelago Holdings LLC, which operates the Archipelago electronic communications network, will acquire the Pacific Exchange's struggling stock-trading business. In return, the Pacific Exchange, based in San Francisco, will become a minority shareholder in Archipelago and provide regulatory and exchange-management services to the new entity. The plan is subject to regulatory approvals. Archipelago is one of the fast-growing screen-based trading systems that have grabbed almost a third of the Nasdaq Stock Market's volume. They have taken very little share of NYSE-listed volume, however, partly because they are technically brokers, and only stock exchanges have full access to the linkages between the venues that trade NYSE stocks.
Global investors spent another day dumping many of the world's most high-priced technology stocks, though by the end of the day there were nascent signs that the selling pressure may be about to ease. Much of the selling came in reaction to the Nasdaq Stock Market's 4.1 decline Tuesday, and many analysts believe technology shares globally will remain volatile until the U.S. technology barometer finds traction. The Nasdaq closed down yesterday an additional 2.6. Still, the blue-chip technology stocks in Japan that ignited this week's global selloff appear to have found their footing again with two straight days of gains. Other Asian markets, meanwhile, managed to bounce off their lows and close with minor losses. I think the pullback will be shortlived, said Robert Reiner, portfolio manager at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. There is still a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to get in. In Europe, technology, media and telecom declines dragged down the broader markets, but investors showed selective interest in some Old Economy industrial stocks. Latin American stocks edged higher.
WASHINGTON -- For months, market-watchers and analysts have been on the lookout for any sign that inflation -- largely dormant for years -- may be stirring. But the latest gauge, the Labor Department's February producer-price index, which measures prices paid to the nation's farms, factories and refineries, proved inconclusive. Inflation hawks could cite the index's larger-than-expected 1 increase, the largest monthly advance since October 1990, as evidence that a broader resurgence may be on the horizon. As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4 higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months. On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3 for the month, with a 6.3 surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1, the lowest year-over-year change since last November. Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 499.19 points -- a record rise when measured by points gained -- to close at 10630.60 as investors poured cash into blue-chip stocks. Bonds, which tend to fall in price on any sign of inflation, actually rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury bond rose 1032 point, about 3.125 for a bond with a 1,000 face amount. The issue's yield eased to 6.238.
CHICAGO -- Online grocer Peapod Inc. questioned its ability to keep operating after losing its chief executive and a vital cash infusion of 120 million. The suddenness and seriousness of those setbacks incited an enormous sell-off of Peapod stock, which fell 4.0938, or 52, to 3.7188, as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading -- a 52-week low. For many investors the implications extended beyond Peapod and other online grocers to the vast array of profitless e-commerce companies that are dependent on the faith and funds of venture capitalists. It is symptomatic of the New Economy where companies are able to go public with unproven business models when they are still losing money, said Barry Stouffer, senior analyst covering Internet grocers at J.C. Bradford & Co. of Nashville, Tenn. The crisis prompted an immediate Peapod search for strategic alternatives including a sale of the company. Peapod said it has only 3 million in cash on hand to cover debts of an amount it wouldn't disclose.
WILMINGTON, Del. -- Loehmann's Inc. said it will file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code within a week, according to documents filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Still, the discount-apparel retailer, operating under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since May when it also was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market, is asking the court for a 90-day extension of its exclusive periods to file a reorganization plan and solicit votes in favor of it. Extending the debtor's exclusive periods will provide the debtor with sufficient time to fully review and consider all comments to its draft plan before filing the final document and will provide creditors with sufficient time to consider the proposed reorganization, Loehmann's said. If its request is granted, Loehmann's, New York, would have the exclusive right to file a plan through June 12 and the sole right to solicit plan acceptances through Aug. 11. Loehmann's also is asking the court to extend the time within which it must assume or reject its leases of nonresidential property to June 12. A hearing on the exclusivity-extension request is scheduled for March 29. The deadline for objections is Friday. Loehmann's said its official committee of unsecured creditors, with which it has worked extensively in finalizing the plan provisions, supports the exclusivity extension. Loehmann's filed for Chapter 11 protection May 18, listing assets of 189 million and liabilities of 184 million.
You've just been given 200 million to invest, but with a catch. You can buy only Internet stocks. And you're expected to deliver big returns, while avoiding risks. That's the opportunity -- and challenge -- facing mutual-fund manager Matthew Ervin, who finds himself on a recent day trying to pursuade his boss that he has found Net stocks that fit these seemingly contradictory criteria. With feigned patience, he paces a sunlit conference room, explaining the history of computing Computers have gotten progressively faster, but until recently, everything was slowed by the lack of bandwidth. Now that the pipes have opened up, a new era has dawned, and companies seizing that change would be great investments for his soon-to-be launched mutual fund, even at today's sky-high prices. Morty Schaja, president of Baron Capital Group, disagrees with his fund manager. I'm uncomfortable with the business, he says. But if the valuation was 10 or 20 times less than it is now, I might be interested. Too risky, too expensive. And so it goes as Mr. Ervin, 30 years old, and his co-manager, Mitchell Rubin, 34, try to identify stocks for one of the latest entries in the Internet-fund sweepstakes Baron iOpportunity. At this point, late in the afternoon of Feb. 29, just 18 hours before the fund goes live, the managers have approvals to buy just 15 stocks, unless prices drop significantly. Yet they have a lot of cash to put to work -- 199,626,449.63 to be precise. That's the amount Baron, a highly respected boutique-fund family, has raised for the new portfolio.
Concerned about unfair and deceptive lending practices in the mortgage industry, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that he has called on a group of federal law enforcers and bank regulators to examine ways to solve the problem. Greenspan said officials from the Justice Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Trade Commission, and six banking and credit-union regulatory agencies, including the Fed, have been meeting informally since October to tackle the practice, called predatory lending. Such lending is believed to be mostly targeted at poor, underserved consumers, especially blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. Sources involved with the group said that so far its meetings have focused on gauging the scope of the problem and how best to grapple with it. The group hopes to have some recommendations for its members as well as for Congress by year's end. North Carolina last year enacted a law to curb predatory lending, and several other states, including New York, are considering similar steps. But the federal government has been criticized for not doing more. For example, according to participants in the group, the Fed itself has not written rules describing what constitutes unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices, even though Congress gave it the authority to do so six years ago in legislation aimed at curbing predatory lending. Some members of Congress think that law has not worked as intended and needs to be strengthened.
Some Federal Reserve officials, increasingly concerned that strong economic growth risked an acceleration of inflation, urged that the Fed raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point at a policymaking session on Feb. 2, according to minutes of the meeting released yesterday. But a majority of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's top policymaking group, preferred raising the target for overnight interest rates by only a quarter- point, the view that prevailed. Last week, at the subsequent FOMC meeting, the target was lifted again by a quarter-point. Some analysts said that because economic growth hasn't slowed, some Fed officials probably were pushing again for a larger move. Many of the analysts and investors expect at least one and possible two further increases at the FOMC meetings in mid-May and late June. At the February session, a majority of the committee cited significant uncertainties about the future course of the economy, including any impact of three earlier rate boosts on the pace of economic growth and unsettled conditions in financial markets, as reasons for moving slowly.
Alice Rivlin, head of the District of Columbia's control board, thought the Woman's National Democratic Club invited her to lunch last week to make a Women's History Month speech. To her surprise, she was not only a speaker--but also the topic of speeches by Mayor Anthony Williams U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget and Robert Litan, Brookings Institution vice president. WNDC President Anna Stout introduced them all. They had gathered to honor Rivlin with the WNDC's Democratic Woman of the Year Award. The praise was high for her distinguished public service. Besides heading the control board, she has served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and director of the Office of Management and Budget, and was the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office. Williams, speaking mostly off the cuff, said, Alice and I have a unique relationship. I'm trying to put her out of business at the control board and she's trying to help me. In her previous life, she helped balance the books for our entire country. We haven't always agreed on every detail, but we share a common commitment to completing the financial recovery, moving back toward self- government and helping this city take its place alongside Paris and Rome as a great world capital. Mary Ellen Withrow, U.S. treasurer, praised Rivlin's many efforts, but it is her unspoken talent as a role model for women-- especially Democratic women--that most captured Withrow's attention.
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico may be starting to suffer from too much of a good thing. That has authorities worried. Good news since the year's start -- including the surging price of oil, falling inflation and the decision by Moody's Investors Service Inc. this month to elevate the country to investment grade -- has strengthened the peso by more than 4, reignited domestic demand and caused a deterioration in the trade balance. All of this makes Mexico vulnerable to a sharp economic correction if the price of oil, Mexico's single largest export, falls more than expected, or if the economy of the U.S. -- the country's largest trading partner -- slows precipitously. I've seen this movie before and I don't want to see it again, central-bank governor Guillermo Ortiz says. It's a bad movie. Problem is, there isn't much authorities can do to choke off rising domestic demand. Monetary policy, exercised through the corto, a mechanism that drains liquidity from the interbank market, is already tight. So, too, is fiscal policy, despite the room for relaxation afforded by strong oil prices in the past year. There is little political incentive to put an end to the fiesta, given that the most fiercely contested presidential election in Mexican history takes place in early July and that the purchasing power of most people here still hasn't recovered to the levels they enjoyed when President Ernesto Zedillo took office in 1994.
NEW YORK -- Weakened by last week's sell-off and desperate for a life preserver, technology stocks instead got a millstone -- courtesy of Microsoft -- and sank along with it. Many of the best-performing stocks of this year's first quarter suffered losses. Applied Micro Circuits fell 32 78 to 117 316. Juniper Networks dropped 30 916 to 233. Sandisk declined 17 12 to 105. PMC-Sierra slid 34 116 to 169 58. And Rambus, the best-performing name so far during 2000up 337 for the period-surrendered 37 916 to 256 1516. All trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The psychology has changed, even though the fundamentals have not, said Thomas Galvin, the chief market strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. We're in a hand-wringing high-technology correction. The sell-off was sparked by news that Microsoft couldn't reach a settlement with the government in its antitrust suit. Drug, financial and retail blue chips all mounted big improvements during Monday's trading. Merck gained 4 58 to 66 34. J.P. Morgan added 10 to 141 34, the first time it has traded that high since November. Wal-Mart Stores gained 5 78 to 61 12.
THE STOCK MARKET STAGED one of its biggest declines and one of its biggest recoveries-all in the same day. The Nasdaq was down 574.57 points at its low, before rebounding to finish at 4148.89, off 74.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 503.53 at its low, but recovered to end down only 57.09 at 11164.84. The market's swings could signal some modest slowing of the economy, but the Fed still is likely to raise rates again when it meets next month. --- Judge Jackson told Microsoft and the government that he wants to move quickly to determine penalties in the antitrust case, and then immediately seek an appeal to avoid disrupting the economy. Microsoft shares fell 2.3125, extending Monday's 14 drop. --- Netscape is introducing a major overhaul of its Web browser, the first since it became part of AOL last year. AOL said the move, which follows the Microsoft ruling, is coincidental.
NEW YORK -- Something strange is afoot in the mortgage market -- and it is causing home buyers to fork over more money. By all accounts, rates on mortgages should be tumbling. That is because mortgage rates typically track interest rates on long-term bonds, which have been falling since the beginning of the year. But mortgage rates have remained essentially flat, causing the gap between mortgage rates and bond yields to widen by the largest measure in years. Unfortunately for home buyers, this trend comes just at the beginning of the spring buying season, when activity in the residential real-estate market peaks. Freddie Mac, the mortgage servicer, said yesterday that the rate for a 30-year-fixed-rate mortgage averaged 8.20 this week. While down slightly from 8.23 last week, it isn't much different from three months ago, when the average rate was 8.15. During the same period, yields on 10-year Treasury notes, most frequently used to set mortgage rates, have fallen to about 5.9 from about 6.5. They were quoted at 5.915 late yesterday. On a 200,000 mortgage, the difference between an 8.2 rate and a 7.6 rate is about 84 a month on a 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage.
WASHINGTON -- The jobless rate continues to hover near its 30-year low, but new government data don't shed much light on whether it will fall still further in the months to come. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 in March despite the creation of 416,000 new jobs, the sharpest monthly gain in more than four years, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 for 24 months in a row. Most economists had expected the jobless rate to slip back to 4 in March, which would have tied a 30-year-low set in January, and many still project a 4 rate for April. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits, meanwhile, fell to a 27-year-low for the week ending April 1, lending further credence to the argument that the labor market may still be contracting. Still, there's another plausible interpretation. March's surge in payroll growth comes on the heels of a weaker-than-expected February increase of just 7,000 jobs, revised downwards from a previous estimate of 43,000 new positions. And while more jobs were created in March than in any month since February 1996, when 454,000 new positions were added to business payrolls, the number may be significantly overstated. The Census Bureau, for example, hired 117,000 temporary workers in March, while a statistical quirk gave the month a fiveweek survey period instead of the customary four-week period, adding about 75,000 jobs. Stripping away such factors brings the actual number of new positions down to a more moderate 224,000. Indeed, excluding all special factors, payroll growth slowed to about 190,000 per month in the first quarter of this year, compared with an average of 226,000 per month in 1999.
The truth is that even for rich people there are good days and bad days on the stock market. The other day was a bad day, and billionaires lost a bundle. How do rich people deal with bad days This is my guess. Bill Gates comes home from the office, and his wife senses something is wrong. What happened she asks while putting his Microsoft slippers on. Just then the phone rings. Gates says to his wife, It's Steve Ballmer. He lost 3.7 billion in Hong Kong. Mrs. Gates says, What's the big deal Tell him all of us lose some and win some--as long as we don't lose our private planes. Bill Gates says, Steve wants to know if he can borrow a couple of billion so he can fix his driveway.
John Schott loaded up on biotechnology stocks last year, then watched them soar fourfold. He sold a few but held on to most -- only to see the prices cut in half in a matter of days. His reaction Easy come, easy go. All through the '90s we've tended to have these rolling crashes, says the 62-year-old suburban-Philadelphia investor. That tends to inure you to the whole thing. Without question, the volatility in stock prices is unprecedented. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite Index moved 2 or more on a quarter of the trading days. That was the most in the Nasdaq Stock Market's 29-year history. But this year is more volatile still More than half of the trading days have seen the index close up or down by at least 2. Yesterday, it swung all the way from being up 3.8 to being down 2.5 at its close of 3676.78. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing established, blue-chip stocks, is fluctuating the most it has in a decade. Investors had better get used to it. The broad embrace of momentum investing by big and small investors alike, the growth of technology stocks that are intrinsically volatile, and the Internet's instant news and inexpensive trading all suggest that the market is becoming more susceptible to sudden surges and swoons. How much does this volatility really matter Clearly, that depends partly on where stocks go from here. With its 27.2 sell-off since its March 10 high, the Nasdaq Composite is in what Wall Street customarily calls a bear market, but it is still up 45.8 from 12 months ago.
Retail gasoline prices dropped 5.4 cents from their all-time highs to an average of 1.489 a gallon since last month, tracking a recent drop in crude oil prices, AAA reported. Last month, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to re-inject more oil into the world market, easing crude oil prices and, in turn, allowing lofty gasoline prices to settle back, AAA said in its monthly report on fuel prices. Comsat of Bethesda has won a court battle to reinstate a five- year Navy contract for satellite telecommunications services that could be worth up to 111.9 million, the company said. Comsat won the contract last June, but Stratos Mobile Networks USA challenged the award. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims sided with Stratos and blocked Comsat from future work under the contract, but this week the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed and vacated that ruling. The contract involves providing access to the Inmarsat satellite network for high- speed data, voice and multimedia communications. The Navy can buy services as needed over the five-year period, up to a total potential value of 111.9 million. The Federal Reserve, responding to complaints from the European Union, said foreign banks are treated fairly under new U.S. rules that permit banks to expand their services. Among other things, the Europeans have raised concerns about rules governing capital requirements for foreign banks that want to expand beyond their core banking business to sell securities, insurance and other services in the United States. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will distribute posters to better alert the public to recalls of dangerous products. The posters will join the FBI's Most Wanted list in 33,000 post offices, where 7 million people go each day to mail letters and ship packages. The first posters should be up later this week. Sears, Roebuck, the second-largest U.S. retailer, said its stores will mainly sell computers made by Compaq Computer and drop PCs made by Hewlett-Packard and eMachines. Sears will continue to carry Apple Computer's iMac and Sony's laptop computers. The Compaq computers, which will be available in June or July, will be built to order and specially designed for Sears customers.
NEW YORK -- A week that began with some of the most powerful rallies in the stock market's history ended with a whimper in the options market. Volatility, a major factor in the price of options, remained at elevated levels, while equity and index options trading patterns indicated that traders were still nervous. The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, fell 1.93 to 28.31. When the VIX declines, it normally means traders are increasingly optimistic about the stock market. But yesterday's expiration of April options contracts likely depressed the index. That is because dealers unwound hedges that had been initiated to offset risk associated with filling options orders executed by money managers and retail investors. Indeed, Schaeffer's Investment Research, a trading-advisory firm, advised clients that it was shifting its short-term stock-market outlook to neutral from bullish because the VIX is trending higher. The VIX has closed above the psychologically significant 30 level for five of the past six sessions. Whenever the VIX trends higher, the market tends to undergo weakness, Schaeffer's said in a research report yesterday.
NEW YORK -- After mild fluctuations, major currencies ended little changed. With European financial markets closed for the Easter holiday and little data to trade on, analysts say investors initially sold technology stocks and the dollar on news that Microsoft Corp. might be forced to split off its various divisions. The dollar rebounded during the New York session, despite a mixed performance in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq Composite Index fell about 160 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 62 points. It takes more than Nasdaq moves lately to have a sustained impact on the dollar, said Bob Lynch, currency strategist in New York with French bank Paribas. The impact the Microsoft report had might have been more sizable than normal, too, because there was nothing else to focus on. Late Monday, the dollar was at 105.79 yen, nearly unchanged from 105.84 yen late Friday. The euro was at 93.75 cents, little changed from 93.81 cents late Friday in New York. Against the yen, the euro slid to 99.22 yen from 99.36 yen late Friday.
Let's get one thing straight B.F. Goodrich doesn't make tires. In fact, it hasn't made tires since 1986, when it sold that business to France's Groupe Michelin in order to focus on more-lucrative operations aerospace parts, engineered products and chemicals. Last July, still trying to distinguish itself from the tire industry, the company moved its headquarters from Richfield, Ohio, near Akron, the rubber capital of the world, to Charlotte, N.C., home of Coltec Industries, an aircraft-parts maker that Goodrich bought last year for 1.6 billion in stock and cash. The company is so fed up with its case of mistaken identity that it even considered changing its name to Inrich combining innovation and Goodrich before scrapping that idea. Now, it is seeking a moniker that still includes Goodrich. Despite lingering confusion over its business lines, investors are warming to the company, whose stock-market value totals 3.3 billion. From a 52-week low of 21 in mid-December, the shares have risen to around 30. But Goodrich is still an old economy bargain, bullish analysts say. They envision a gain of 40 or more in the next 12 months, to as much as 43. There's a lot of value in B.F. Goodrich, says Mark Parker, chief executive of Joseph Parker & Co., a Thomasville, Ga., money manager that owns nearly 72,000 shares. Their earnings and sales keep growing, and nobody seems to care. The stock trades at about 10 times analysts' average 2000 earnings estimate of 3.16 a share. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index carries a higher PE of 25.
As the tech-stock shakeout on Wall Street continues, global money is likely to seek out better returns in markets outside the U.S. But don't expect Asia to be the big beneficiary. Analysts suggest that any U.S. capital flight following Nasdaq's recent correction is more likely to go to Europe than to Asia. The money that does cross the Pacific may be destined largely for Japan, rather than for the smaller Asian economies that need the capital most. Asian markets were mixed as many investors took a wait-and-see approach following Monday's Nasdaq turbulence. Renewed buying interest in blue chips led European markets higher, despite weakness in technology stocks. Latin American shares also rallied. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 4.07, or 1.69, to 244.32. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.21, or 0.12, to 179.35. Amid the rise in uncertainties overhanging the U.S. market, many predict a continued shift of money abroad. What we're seeing is just the normal process of portfolio rebalancing, says James Lucier Jr., a Prudential Securities Inc. senior analyst. A year and a half ago you had calamity in Asia, recession in Japan and slow growth everywhere else, which made the U.S. a haven of last resort and a disproportionately hot place to invest in. The U.S. still looks attractive but Europe and Japan in some respects are looking more attractive. Who will benefit from the outflow, however, is less clear, with some analysts noting that the flow of money into Asian stocks this year has slacked off. The share of portfolio money in the U.S. and Europe slated for non-U.S. markets has risen this year, but the share specifically slated for Asia hasn't, says Ajay Kapur, a Hong Kong-based regional strategist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The state's biggest law firms are caught up in a bidding war for top law-school graduates, and corporate clients will inevitably pick up part of the tab. Salary inflation has reached such extremes that hundreds of wet-behind-the-ears lawyers in this state will gross 115,000 this year -- the same as the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Twenty-seven-year-old Trent McKenna, who started last year with the Houston office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld L.L.P. at a base salary of 78,000, has already received raises of about 37,000. It's not so much that we're 100 worth whatever salary, he says. What's driving this is that we're a commodity that is more scarce than it used to be. The root cause of the salary surge is the booming economy. In particular, dot-coms are competing for top legal talent by offering lucrative stock options. The biggest Texas law firms expect to shell out up to 12 million each in extra salaries this year. That could have drastic consequences, and not just for the legal profession In-coming lawyers will be asked to work more hours partners at top firms may make less money and big firms could lose clients to cheaper firms or in-house lawyers. Some worry that big law firms will cut back on pro bono services. Debby Ackerman, associate general counsel for Southwest Airlines Co. in Dallas, says that while it's usually worth paying for top talent, her company might bring more work in-house if legal salaries keep rising. If the rates go up again, clearly that would be too much pressure, she says.
With the stock market as spongy as a swamp, and initial public offerings disappearing as if they were swallowed by quicksand, three fearless Washington entrepreneurs are nonetheless starting down the path toward going public. While several would-be public companies in the region have pushed the pause button on their IPOs and the most recent one instantly fell below its offering price, three new deals have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nettel Communications Inc. of Washington, which provides communications services to medium-size businesses, hopes to raise 175 million in an offering that was filed last Friday and made public this week. MainControl Inc. of McLean hopes to raise about 57 million with an offering that hit the SEC two weeks ago. The company creates software that businesses use to manage their e-infrastructure, which to non-geeks means their office computers, networks, Internet connections and other information technology equipment. Vastera Inc. of Dulles wants to sell 70 million worth of stock. In an April 7 filing, Vastera said it provides international trade management services, using the Internet to help companies make their importing and exporting operations more efficient.
NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks finished modestly lower in one of the most gently traded sessions this year. Investors apparently decided, after being handed data expected to provide insight into what the Federal Reserve plans to do with interest rates this month, that they hadn't seen enough information to guide their investing. A few rate-sensitive growth stocks wobbled in the session, including General Electric, off 2 116 to 154, AT&T, which lost 1 316 to 38 716, and General Motors, down 1 12 to 86 916. Banks also suffered declines. Chase Manhattan lost 1 to 73 14. Citigroup gave up 1 12 to 58 58. FleetBoston Financial fell 1516 to 33 18. But they weren't the kind of vigorous moves usually associated with downbeat inflation data. Ahead of the session, the federal government released a report that showed worker productivity rose 2.4 in the first quarter this year, well off the 6.9 growth pace of the fourth quarter, and south of the forecasts of 3.5 growth. The same report also showed unit-labor costs picked up during the quarter, suggestive of the sort of inflation pressures likely to spur the Fed to active management of the economy's expansion through further -- and likely larger -- rate increases.
It isn't often that Canadians get to boast about having one of the world's top-performing stock markets, but hot technology and communications stocks have put Canadian indexes in the limelight. Though Asian markets generally fared even better last year, Canada handily outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe. Many investors still think of Canada's stock market as a play on natural resources. However, surging shares of such high-tech names as Nortel Networks Corp., BCE Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corp. with headquarters in both San Jose, Calif., and Nepean, Ontario have pushed Canada's traditional sectors into the shadows over the past year. Technology and communications stocks accounted for about 51 of the weighting of the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index at the end of the first quarter. That compared with a weighting of just 15 for all of Canada's energy, mining and forest-products companies. Though some high-tech stocks have since plunged amid the sector's wobbles, telecom-equipment giant Nortel has seen its shares hold up well in the wake of strong earnings. The weighting of Canada's resource stocks in the TSE 300 has long been declining as commodity producers disappointed investors and companies in other fields prospered. The combined weighting of resource companies has fallen from 20 two years ago and 29 a decade ago. Over the past six months or so, many foreign investors have woken up to the fact that there's much more going on here than rocks and trees, says George Vasic, market strategist with Bunting Warburg Dillon Read Inc. in Toronto. Mr. Vasic says the TSE 300's heavy weighting in technology stocks makes it perhaps the second-greatest tech index behind the tech-drenched Nasdaq Composite Index in the U.S.
Shares of Plug Power Inc. fell nearly 6 Friday after two analysts downgraded the stock. The stock-price decline came a day after the designer of consumer fuel cells said design changes relieved its joint-venture partner, General Electric Co., of a contractual obligation to purchase 485 fuel cells, the bulk of its projected product sales this year. That drop followed a nearly 27 decline on Thursday, when Plug Power made the disclosure in its first-quarter earnings report. Shares fell 3.4375, or 5.8, at 56 at 4 p.m. Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Plug Power shares have lost nearly twothirds of their value since hitting a 52-week high of 156.50 on Jan. 24. On Thursday, Plug Power, Latham, N.Y., said fuel-cell units it was designing and which GE planned to market for the company didn't conform to specifications agreed upon in a February 1999 contract, which relieved GE of the obligation to buy them. The company, which didn't disclose the precise specifications for competitive reasons, originally had expected to deliver the fuel cells, which are small, appliancetype units designed as power sources for homes, by year end. The delay is significant because fuelcell technology, while viewed as promising, still is evolving. GE was contracted to pay 10.3 million for the units through the companies' joint venture, GE MicroGen, at a projected loss to Plug Power, then resell them to residential customers for initial field trials. Officials at both companies said GE, Fairfield, Conn., still expects to purchase most, if not all, of the 485 units from Plug Power, albeit some not until 2001, and said other aspects of their relationship remain intact. GE owns a 12 stake in Plug Power, and the head of GE Power Systems, Robert L. Nardelli, sits on Plug Power's board.
FRANKFURT -- No matter what rhetoric it uses, the European Central Bank has to keep raising interest rates in lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve -- or risk an even sharper decline to the already sinking euro. With the U.S economy growing so strongly and signs of inflation beginning to emerge, the Fed is firmly on the path toward higher U.S. interest rates. That puts strong pressure on the ECB to lift European rates -- even beyond what is necessary to control European growth pressures. For some of the smaller ECB member countries, this is an ironic change of circumstances. In the years prior to the formation of the ECB, less economically advanced countries often complained of being held hostage to the monetary policy of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, over which they had no say. Germany was, and still is, the major economic power in Europe and to remain on a level playing field with Germany, other central banks had to follow the Bundesbank's lead. But with the ECB, the rest of Europe thought they would finally have a voice. Instead, they now feel they're hostage to Alan Greenspan. The euro, the shared currency of 11 nations, has lost 24 of its value against the dollar since its inception in January 1999. For many reasons, global investors appear to prefer to put money in the U.S. instead of Europe, and the European currency is suffering as a result. To name a few ever-stronger economic reports from the U.S. and relatively weaker performance of Europe the magnetic U.S. stock market political uncertainty in Italy the likelihood of highly indebted Greece, though economically insignificant, joining the euro next year the investigation of Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the Bank of France and heir apparent to the ECB president, for possible wrongdoings when he was in the French treasury the inability of Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG to pull off a merger and the resignation of the European Commission's executive body last year. Wim Duisenberg, the ECB's president, even listed the Balkan war as a reason for the euro's mysterious decline.
This is a routine flight to Beijing from the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, and while the Gobi desert slips by below, up here American business is on the move. Two cashmere dealers based in the U.S. and an American suit maker based in Mongolia pick through their airline lunches. They're discussing the pricing of an order placed by Wal-Mart with a Mongolian cashmere company and what kind of computer system for designing menswear might be bought in Beijing and brought back to help make suits in Ulan Bator, to ship to buyers in the U.S. The suit maker even has a prospective buyer coming down from Siberia to see if U.S.-designed Mongolian-made clothes might fit the Russian market. Globalization has been with us one way or another for a long time. In brutal form, for example, when Genghis Khan's armies rode forth from Mongolia about 800 years ago to conquer the known world, and in a gentler manner later the same century when Marco Polo trekked the other direction from Venice to China. But today, between the advent of such technologies as the Internet and the end of such deadweight as Soviet rule, globalization is moving with a speed and agility that just a few years ago most modern world travelers scarcely imagined. Between 1990-99, the real volume of world merchandise exports grew 72. Especially significant is that merchandise exports of developing nations grew last year by 8.5, more than twice the global average, according to the World Trade Organization. This suggests still larger trade leaps in the offing, as countries long self-exiled from world markets rearrange their institutions to become global players. Though statistics tell the abstract story, they do not convey the energy with which enterprise is finding its way into places that for much of the past century had fallen off the commercial map. A recent trip to Mongolia from a small town in upstate New York offers at each step a chance to see the speed at which globalization is now seeking its level. Start with a visit to almost any U.S. discount store to buy some traveling clothes. The labels amount to a roster of near-forgotten countries now waking up. Along with the by now standard nightgowns made in Costa Rica and blouses from Bangladesh, there are T-shirts from Swaziland, Burma and Cambodia. From the former Soviet state of Moldova -- how many American shoppers had heard of it 10 years ago -- we see flower-print pajamas. From the former Soviet backlot of Turkmenistan, in Central Asia, come tank tops.
In a significant concession to the growing number of investors buying and selling at lightning speed, asset-management giant Vanguard Group said it will add new mutual-fund products that trade throughout the day like a stock. The decision to seek Securities and Exchange Commission approval for the new investment vehicles comes after months of hand wringing at the nation's second-largest mutual-fund firm. During the past year or so, low-cost exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have surged in popularity on the American Stock Exchange, threatening to steal business from Vanguard's franchise index funds. ETFs are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be bought or sold during the day at market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional mutual funds. The new Vanguard ETFs will compete with upstart ETFs offered by State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors and Barclays PLC's Barclays Global Investors, among others. Vanguard, based in Malvern, Pa., studied the easily traded products for years, and began seriously considering them as an add-on to their traditional index mutual funds about a year ago. Industry observers said Vanguard's entry could prompt other fund companies to add ETFs to their traditional index funds. It's really a case of Vanguard's premier brand name putting the Good Housekeeping seal of approval on exchange-traded funds, said Burt Greenwald, a mutual-fund consultant in Philadelphia. The new products, to be called Viper shares and listed on the American exchange, will be added as a new share class to five of the company's most prominent index funds the 105 billion-in-assets Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the 19 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund, the 16 billion Vanguard Growth Index Fund, the 4 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund and the 3 billion Vanguard Value Index Fund. Pending regulatory approval by the SEC, the new share class will be introduced during the third quarter, a Vanguard spokesman said.
It's better to build than to buy. That is the current mantra of online brokerage firms, whose ranks have ballooned in recent years and now number about 140. But with prices and activity on the Nasdaq Stock Market -- playground of online traders -- swooning since March, a shakeout among online brokers seems inevitable. This industry is absolutely ripe for consolidation, says Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. You've got a glut of capacity out there. Yes, yes. But not so fast. What's holding things up is a little-known fact It remains far cheaper for online brokers to acquire new accounts through massive ad spending than to gobble up smaller rivals.
WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. factories, mines and utilities continued to accelerate in April, offering further evidence of the economy's strength in the face of rising interest rates. Industrial output jumped 0.9 last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1 higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3 increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly. With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4 to 82.1, the first time that the index has climbed above 82 in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecks The report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years. Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6 run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7 in April, and is up an eye-popping 59 year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6 after being flat the last two months.
MicroStrategy chief executive Michael J. Saylor has personally guaranteed a line of credit for the Vienna-based software company and has backed the guarantee with collateral, MicroStrategy reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To secure the loan, Saylor pledged all the financial assets held in an account of Alcantara LLC, according to a document filed with the SEC. Alcantara is the vehicle through which Saylor owned 43.1 million of his 43.8 million shares of MicroStrategy, as of March 31. The company had fallen out of compliance with the conditions of a 25 million bank credit line. But with Saylor's guarantee, Bank of America has increased the credit line to 28.6 million. Saylor does not receive any compensation for providing the guarantee, MicroStrategy reported. Industrial production last month made its largest gain in 20 months, reinforcing expectations that Federal Reserve policymakers will raise interest rates when they meet today. Output at factories, mines and utilities increased 0.9 percent in April after rising 0.7 percent in March, more than previously reported, Fed figures showed. The April increase was the largest since a 1.8 percent rise in August 1998, when General Motors factories rebounded from a two-month strike. Continental Airlines, after leading a round of air-fare increases over the weekend, surprisingly rescinded its decision. Before Continental's reversal, the nation's three largest air carriers-- United, American and Delta--said they would match the increases of 10 to 30 a round trip on business and leisure fares. Arlington- based US Airways had matched both increases Friday but changed course yesterday, keeping the fare increase on business fares but not leisure fares. Continental cited rising fuel costs as its original reasons for boosting fares. Choice One Communications will double its territory as a provider of Internet and telephone service with the purchase of US Xchange for about 517.5 million in cash and stock. Choice One, which serves the Northeast, will pay 311 million in cash and 7 million shares for the closely held US Xchange, which provides local and long-distance telephone service to about 17,000 business and residential customers in four Midwestern states. EMC, the largest maker of computer data-storage systems, canceled a year-old plan to buy 3 billion worth of hard drives from IBM, amid worries at IBM that a delay in introducing new drives will cut into second-quarter revenue. EMC cited production delays and said it worked out a new purchase agreement that doesn't include a specific amount. The agreement is part of an effort by the two companies to settle all patent suits against each other.
MEXICO CITY -- On a day when fears that a cooling in the U.S. economy could damp Mexico's expansion, figures released by the country's Finance Ministry showed there's plenty of momentum here. Mexico's gross domestic product surged at an annual rate of 7.9 in the first quarter, its fastest clip in 212 years and well above expectations, as the strong peso and low inflation helped spread the economic recovery to all sectors. Mexico's industrial sector expanded by 8.6 from a year earlier, with manufacturing output rising 9.4. Construction expanded 6.9, while mining and energy sectors also increased by healthy margins. Mexican officials noted that the first-quarter results were skewed by several additional working days in the period. Strong fundamentals are the real story behind the surge, analysts said. Even before garnering a coveted investment-grade rating from Moody's Investor Service Inc. in March, the country had met its overseas debt obligations for 2000. Moreover, despite increased government spending this election year, Finance Minister Angel Gurria confirmed Mexico is on track to meet its target of a budget deficit of 1 of gross domestic product for 2000. slightly better than 1999's 1.15 figure.
Texas looks sharp when it comes to today's high-tech industry. But the Lone Star state lags a bit when it comes to its spending on tomorrow. That's according to the fourth edition of the American Electronics Association's Cyberstates A State-by-State Overview of the High-Technology Industry. The report, which is being released today, takes a number of different measures of the state's high-tech industry -- including its employment, wages and share of exports -- and compares them with those of other states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The report, funded in part by the Nasdaq Stock Market, also provides an analysis of both high-tech venture-capital investments and research-and-development expenditures. The association defines high tech using three broad categories manufacturing, communications services, and software and computer-related services. The definition doesn't include such fields as biotechnology or aerospace. In high-tech employment, the Lone Star State ranked high For every 1,000 private-sector workers in 1998, 56 were employed by high-tech firms, or 22 more than the total U.S. share of high-tech employees. That placed Texas 11th in the country in terms of that concentration -- behind such states as California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Colorado had the highest concentration of high-tech workers 84 for every 1,000 private-sector workers, while Wyoming ranked last, with 14. The number of high-tech employees that Texas hired grew by a healthy 48, compared with the national average of 28, placing Texas 10th. North Dakota's high-tech employment grew 90, placing it first, while Indiana was last with a decline of 7.
High tech is raining prosperity down on the region. That's according to the fourth edition of the American Electronics Association's Cyberstates A State-by-State Overview of the High-Technology Industry. The report, which is being released today, takes a number of different measures of the region's high-tech industry -- including its employment, wages and share of exports -- and compares them with those of other states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The report, funded in part by the Nasdaq Stock Market, also provides an analysis of both high-tech venture-capital investments and research-and-development expenditures. The association defines high-tech using three broad categories manufacturing, communications services, and software and computer-related services. This definition doesn't include such fields as biotechnology or aerospace. High-tech employees in Washington state were the best paid around as of 1998, earning an average annual salary of 105,681 -- almost twice the U.S. average of 57,701. And it's more than three times the state's average private-sector wage of 32,914. Dick Conway, a Seattle economist who tracks regional business issues, attributes that to the high stock-option income at Microsoft Corp. Puerto Rico had the lowest high-tech wage at 24,169. By comparison, the average high-tech wage in Oregon was 54,771, ranking the state fifth. But in another measure, the Evergreen State ranked far lower than one might expect 45th in its share of high-tech exports. Again, Microsoft is the culprit, says Mr. Conway, because the software the Redmond-based company sells often doesn't get counted as merchandise by the U.S. Census Bureau, but rather as a service that requires a license to operate.
Lycos Inc. reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter, but its shares plunged more than 20 amid concerns about the proposed takeover by Spain's Terra Networks SA. Lycos shares closed at 57.6094 apiece on the Nasdaq Stock Market, down 15.0156 and almost 40 below the proposed takeover price of 97.55. The sharp drop was highly unusual, and suggests that some Lycos shareholders are worried that Terra isn't a good strategic partner. It may also be a bet that Terra shares will fall further, which could lower the price that Lycos shareholders will receive under the pact. Separately, Waltham, Mass.-based Lycos reported that net income for the period ending April 30 hit 122.4 million, or 1.05 a diluted share, aided by a 270.2 million gain from investments. That reversed a net loss of 13.2 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Operating profit totaled 7.9 million, or seven cents a share, higher than the five cents a share analysts were expecting. The Internet portal reported that revenue more than doubled to 78.6 million, compared with the year-earlier 35.8 million and higher than the 75 million analysts had been expecting. Revenue from advertising, a key yardstick on the Internet, more than doubled to 51.6 million. Paul Noglows, of Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase H&Q unit, called it a good quarter, but pointed out that most investors are focusing on the Terra deal.
NEW YORK -- With the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates behind it, the options market looked forward to its next signpost tomorrow's monthly expiration of options contracts. The problem is, traders and strategists frequently complain that expiration isn't as big an event in the options market as it once was. They say that this is partly because the position-rolling activity isn't as concentrated in the last few days leading up to expiration as it used to be. Cibc World Markets options strategist Michael Schwartz said that a midafternoon scan of yesterday's most-active options contracts yielded few suspects for trades that were rolling positions forward, those that occur when an options player moves a position's expiration farther out, sometimes also using the opportunity to move the strike price up or down. One possibility, though, was Cisco Systems Inc. With the stock falling 2 916 to finish at 58, Cisco's May 60 and June 70 calls were among the most active call contracts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that the activity may have been the result of expiration-related adjustments. Additionally, options trading hasn't been as active as some would like. Paul Foster, options strategist at 1010WallStreet.com, complained that this week's expiration is the driest expiration I've seen in the past 12 months.
The persistent shortage of workers that has been crimping growth plans at many companies won't be ending anytime soon, according to Manpower Inc.'s latest survey of U.S. employers' hiring plans. Demand for employees is still growing, and with unemployment at its current extremely low levels, the traditional labor supply is essentially exhausted, Manpower said. Companies pinched for labor may get a modicum of relief from recent legislative changes that eliminated Social Security earning limits that freed some older workers from restrictions on their ability to work. But recruiting more workers will continue to challenge employers throughout the country, Manpower said. Of the about 16,000 companies that participated in the survey, about 35 said they expect to be recruiting additional workers in the third quarter. That's the highest level seen in the 24 years that the survey has been conducted. During the year-earlier quarter, and again in the second quarter of the current year, the figure was an already very strong 32.

Past performance is a rotten guide to future results. But that hasn't deterred investors. Folks love to pore over stock-market data, hoping to divine the future. But unfortunately, while the past gives credence to certain investment principles, it doesn't offer much help to those looking to beat the market. History Lessons. We have U.S. stock data going back two centuries. What can we learn Three lessons stand out. First, it pays to take risk. The longer we go out, the more pronounced the risk-reward trade-off becomes, says Scott Lummer, chief investment officer of mPower, a San Francisco online investment adviser. Bonds beat cash, stocks beat bonds, small stocks beat large stocks. Second, unlike bonds or Treasury bills, stocks have proven to be a wonderful long-run defense against rising consumer prices, outpacing inflation by an average seven percentage points a year.
The Nasdaq Composite Index came close to crossing 3000 again -- this time from the wrong direction. But the shock of revisiting the milestone apparently helped persuade some investors to step in and buy, turning a potential stock-market rout into a rally. The buying began after the technology-dominated index fell within a hair of the 3000 level that it had crossed triumphantly on Nov. 3 of last year, on its way to 4000 and then 5000 by this past March. All of those previous gains set the stage for the sharp declines that tech stocks have suffered in the past two months. Yesterday's flood of money surged back into the market after a morning decline sent the Nasdaq composite as low as 3042.66. The Nasdaq index closed up 106.06 points, or 3.35, at 3270.61. It had been down 121.89 at midday, so the total swing from low to close was 227.95 points. Names such as Intel, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems were in demand. The violence of the rally caught everyone off guard, said Rob Cohen, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. You might have set a low level for the short term. Still, traders said the volatile market could retest the Nasdaq 3000 level again later. But after days of weak demand for stocks, they said, the return to strong volume was a positive sign. On the New York Stock Exchange, trading volume exceeded one billion shares for the first time since May 2.
WASHINGTON -- Growth in corporate profits slowed in the first months of the year, while profit margins improved only slightly, suggesting that the bottom line at many firms may begin to suffer in the months ahead. In its first look at first-quarter corporate results, the Commerce Department said that profits, adjusted for the impact of inflation on inventories and depreciation, rose 3.8, slightly slower than the 4 gain recorded in the last months of 1999. Profits were 7.6 higher than they were a year earlier, down from a 9.6 year-over-year change in the fourth quarter of last year. Profit margins, meanwhile, inched up 0.1 to 9.8 for the quarter, but have been relatively flat for the past two years. The peak rate of profit growth is behind us, said David Orr, chief economist with First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. There will still be growth, but at a decelerating rate. The numbers were included in the department's revised first-quarter gross-domestic-product report. In the first three months of the year, GDP -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced by the U.S. economy -- surged ahead at a brisk 5.4 annual rate, confirming the department's earlier estimate. Many analysts had expected the GDP numbers -- which came on the heels of a torrid 7.3 pace in the fourth quarter of last year -- to be revised downward slightly. As in the preliminary report, the data suggest that inflationary pressures continue to build in the economy. The gross- domestic-purchases portion of the GDP figures, which Commerce officials point to as the broadest gauge of inflation in the report, rose 3.2 for the quarter, its sharpest gain in more then ten years. The increase, the same as in the department's earlier estimate, follows a 2.3 gain in the fourth quarter of 1999. The measure tracks increases in the prices paid by companies and individuals.
The U.S. economy surged at a 5.4 percent rate in the first three months of the year. But existing-home sales dropped 6.2 percent in April, a sign that the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases are beginning to have an impact. The first-quarter increase in the gross domestic product was slightly bigger than many analysts expected but matched the government's estimate from one month ago. Calpers named Daniel Szente chief investment officer of the nation's largest public pension fund. Szente, 52, was director of research of Pennsylvania-based McGlinn Capital Management. He will oversee the California Public Employees' Retirement System's 175 billion in assets. NextWave's wireless licenses may be auctioned by the FCC, according to one appeals court decision. A federal appeals court in New York has ruled that a bankruptcy court overstepped its authority in blocking the auction. The FCC had canceled 63 spectrum licenses awarded to NextWave Telecom for 4.74 billion after the bankrupt company failed to pay for them on time. The FCC had planned to re- auction the licenses July 26. Whether the auction can occur now is still unclear because the company is pursuing a similar case before a federal appeals court in Washington. Saturn plans to lay off about 490 workers at the assembly plant near Newport, Del., because of slow sales of its new mid-size car. The cuts represent about 19.6 percent of the work force at the plant. Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay Internet portal GoTo.com 21.5 million to settle a copyright-infringement lawsuit over a logo. Disney also agreed to stop using the disputed logo for its Go Network as well as a replacement logo the company devised after a court issued an injunction against it in November.
U.S. durable goods orders fell 6.4 percent in April, the steepest drop in more than eight years, as bookings for electronic equipment such as semiconductors posted a record decline and demand for automobiles weakened. The decrease followed a 4.5 percent gain in March that was higher than previously reported, Commerce Department figures show. Analysts said the decline suggests growth in manufacturing may have peaked after 15 months of advances, as six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve begin to slow consumer purchases. Women earned an average of 76.5 cents on the dollar last year, compared with men doing the same full-time work. The gap was little changed from 1998, when women took home an average of 76.3 cents for every dollar earned by men, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Since 1979, when the agency started keeping track, women have closed the gap by 14 cents. A new e-mail virus disguised as a resume hit a number of U.S. corporations using Microsoft software. Antivirus software makers said the virus, called Resume.A by some, mimics earlier viruses that exploit Microsoft's Outlook e-mail software. The virus, contained in an e-mail attachment that appears to be a resume, sends itself to every user stored in an infected computer's address book. The e-mail carrying the virus generally has a subject line of Resume--Janet Simons. Potomac Electric Power is being sued by Panda Energy International, which is seeking to prevent the District-based utility from selling a 25-year contract to buy electricity from Panda's Brandywine, Md., plant. The suit alleges that Pepco can't sell the contract, agreed to in 1996, without Panda's permission. A Pepco spokesman declined to comment on Panda's claims, saying Pepco hasn't officially been served with the lawsuit. Dallas-based Panda owns power plants in Maryland, North Carolina and Texas. British Telecom must let its competitors supply unmetered access to the Internet over BT's network, Britain's telecommunications watchdog ruled. The ruling by the Office of Telecommunications paves the way for the spread of American-style, flat-rate Internet service and offers the prospect of lower phone bills for millions of British Internet users.
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Some of Brazil's biggest companies have postponed plans to borrow on international debt markets, as lending terms stiffen and foreign investors back off. Several large electric utilities have postponed dollar-denominated debt issues, and firms including cellular and media concerns are looking to local markets and bank loans to finance their operations and repay maturing debt. A new international issue just won't happen right now, says Robert Nydegger, a Latin America corporate credit analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. The cost of debt is just way too expensive. The interest rate on Brazilian corporate bonds has jumped by about two percentage points over the past two months, raising bond yields for some blue-chip companies to nearly 16. The recent half-percentage-point rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve was the breaking point for some companies, whose foreign borrowing rates are priced according to U.S. Treasury bonds. Fresh from a four-city roadshow in the U.S. and Europe, electric utility Light Servicios de Eletricidade SA last week postponed a 150 million bond sale following the Fed move. A person familiar with the issue, who says Light was also following the whipsaw movements of the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, says investors who had tentatively agreed to accept a rate of 9.75 were suddenly demanding payments as high as 11.
Sales of new homes tumbled 5.8 percent in April while a key index of future economic activity slipped 0.1 percent, two signs that the Federal Reserve's higher interest rates are beginning to slow the economy. The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes edged down to an annual rate of 909,000 last month in the biggest one-month drop since a 7.2 percent decrease in September. Meanwhile, the index of leading economic indicators declined by 0.1 percent last month, according to the Conference Board in New York. Virginia's jobless rate dropped to 2.3 percent in April, only the third time the rate has been that low in more than 30 years, the Virginia Employment Commission said. The rate dropped from 2.5 percent in March and was far below the national jobless rate of 3.7 percent in April. The number of Virginians looking for work declined from 91,500 in March to 82,000 in April. Fairfax City had the lowest jobless rate at 0.6 percent, followed by the city of Bedford at 0.7 percent. Manassas Park and Greene, Rockingham and Loudoun counties had rates of 0.9 percent. AT&T, which is trying to become the largest U.S. cable-TV provider through acquisitions, plans to carry the Hot Network, a pay-per-view channel that shows sexually explicit movies. Financial terms were not disclosed. The channel is owned by Hot Networks, a privately owned company that also operates the Hot Zone, another sex-oriented channel. Brown Brothers, Harriman, the oldest privately held U.S. bank, said it will exit the brokerage business to focus on managing money for wealthy individuals. Brown Brothers, founded in 1818, will fire 78 analysts, traders and support staff from among the 125 people who work in its institutional brokerage business. Sunterra, operator of 90 time-share resorts in North America, Europe and Asia, said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection from its creditors after recent losses and debt-payment problems. Orlando-based Sunterra, which employed 7,800 people at the end of December, said last week that it will fire more than 900 workers and cut costs by halting sales at some resorts.
Do you want an investment that's absolutely safe And earning a higher interest rate than you can get at the bank And tax-deferred Take a look at the up-to-date version of U.S. Savings Bonds--the Series I bonds. They're paying an amazing 7.49 percent that's an annualized rate on savings as low as 50. Small savers can't get a higher rate anywhere. Sophisticated savers, with larger portfolios, are buying them, too. If you're balancing risky investments with safe ones, I bonds are the place to look. Series I bonds were introduced in September 1998. So they're still pretty new, and savers may not have heard about them. The I stands for inflation. These bonds guarantee you an attractive, real rate of return, no matter what happens to the inflation rate. Lately, inflation has been rising--so the I bond's total return is rising, too.
NEW YORK -- Barnes & Noble.com Inc. is paying about 20 million for a 20 stake in MightyWords Corp., which offers digital versions of books and texts by both wellknown and unknown authors. MightyWords is being shed by Fatbrain.com Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., online retailer of technical books. Under terms, Barnes & Noble.com will begin offering MightyWords' content on its site. Technical and educational books have provided a market for electronic publishers for several years. But e-publishing burst out to a wider audience earlier this year when Viacom Inc.'s Simon & Schuster Inc. published a novella by Stephen King exclusively on the Internet. MightyWords' writing -- which can be downloaded to a personal computer and then printed onto paper -- includes some romance and fiction by authors including Toni Morrison and Arthur C. Clarke. But much of its subject matter focuses on technical subjects such as business or computing. Fatbrain announced it would shed MightyWords in March, just about the time the stock market soured on Internet investments. Instead of taking the company public, Fatbrain turned to private investors. MightyWords' deal with Barnes & Noble.com is part of the company's initial round of funding, which totals 36 million. Vulcan Ventures Inc., the investment vehicle for Microsoft Corp. cofounder Paul Allen, is investing 10 million in MightyWords and 6 million is coming from other investors.
In Wall Street's leading corporate drama, it's not the opening act that worries investors. It's the encore. What investors fear most these days about Microsoft's antitrust case isn't so much an AT&T-style breakup, but rather conduct remedies that could hobble Microsoft much as International Business Machines was legally hamstrung in the 1970s and 1980s. Investors and analysts still expect Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to endorse the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two one company focusing on computer operating systems, the other on application and Internet software. Even if the ruling isn't overturned on appeal, it might not be so bad in and of itself, some investors say. What if, 18 months ago, Bill Gates said We're getting too big, we're gonna split into three companies,' muses Charles Carlson, manager of the 145 million Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which has a stake in Microsoft. If a breakup had been proposed in that way, Mr. Carlson says The stock would have gone up 50. Well, it didn't. And now, investors increasingly are worrying about the lessobvious conduct remedies, which have been proposed and are expected to be included in Judge Jackson's ruling. As in new rules governing Microsoft's relations with computer makers, Windows pricing and the disclosure of computer source code. These rules are designed to restrain Microsoft from abusing its monopoly in the software business and would expire in three years if Microsoft were broken upor 10 years if it isn't.
LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany -- During a decade as chief executive of BASF AG, Juergen Strube has bucked business cycles and prevailing political winds to transform a provincial German company into the world's biggest integrated chemicals group. After the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, BASF forged a controversial alliance with Russian natural-gas producer RAO Gazprom and spent billions of dollars building pipelines across Germany today, oil and gas is the company's most profitable division. During the 1998 Asian economic crisis, BASF snapped up chemical producers in Korea and speeded up construction of huge chemical complexes in Malaysia and China. Earlier this year, Mr. Strube flouted the furor in Europe over genetically modified crops by launching a 700 million euro 664 million research blitz in plant biotechnology. Then, raising the ante, BASF shelled out 3.8 billion for the agrochemical division of American Home Products Corp. This week, Mr. Strube is pitching an Old Economy story to investors besotted with the New Economy. BASF stock begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. It's the kind of challenge Mr. Strube savors. For all its global clout, BASF remains a relative unknown in U.S. financial markets. American investors currently hold a meager 8.5 of the German company's shares outstanding. BASF isn't issuing any new stock in conjunction with the New York listing. But Mr. Strube hopes the U.S. stock market debut will boost the company's valuation and enable BASF to use its shares to finance future U.S. acquisitions. Despite spending 243 million euros so far on a two billion euro share-buyback program, BASF stock is down more than 10 so far this year at yesterday's closing price of 44.75 euros.
With long-awaited economic figures about to be released, investors hunkered down, pushing down both stock prices and trading volumes. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which gained 19 last week, is now slightly down for this week after giving back 0.36, or 13.70 points, to close at 3825.56. It is a similar story for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 4.8 last week, but down 1.33, or 144.14 points, to 10668.72 yesterday. Other indexes also fell, although bonds and the dollar managed gains. Trading volumes were among the lightest of the year. One reason for the Dow Jones Industrial Average's weakness was an earnings warning from Procter & Gamble. But the bigger issue hanging over the market is a group of economic announcements, starting with May producer prices this morning. That could help determine whether the Federal Reserve feels the need to continue raising interest rates at the end of this month. People are waiting for confirmation of the economic numbers we saw last week, to give them conviction to put more money into this market, said Brian Conroy, head of listed trading at J.P. Morgan.
Fifty-five years ago this September, the Austrian composer Anton von Webern stepped into the autumn night outside the little town of Mittersill, Austria, and lit a cigar. No one knows quite what happened next, but he found himself on the wrong end of a GI's gun, and a few hours later he was dead. It was a death that conductor Pierre Boulez, whose second complete edition of the works of Webern has just been released on Deutsche Grammophon, called absurd in a breathlessly adulatory article about the composer published in 1958. Webern's death at age 61, a war casualty after the war was over, was absurd. It was most likely the result of a jittery soldier working undercover to nab the very same black marketeer who had given Webern his cigar. It was a silly, ignominious death for a composer who had suffered more than his share of unjustified ignominy. The deaths of all three of the great Viennese modernists were absurd. Webern's teacher Arnold Schoenberg, the consummate Viennese curmudgeon, died in Los Angeles in 1951, grumpy, isolated and superstitious almost to the point of paralysis. Fellow Schoenberg disciple Alban Berg died at 50 in 1935 of an abscess that might have been easily treated today. Although Schoenberg lived well into his seventies, not one of this great trinity of modernism, who elaborated a succession of post- tonal styles--most famously the 12-tone technique and serialism-- really got to be a grand old man. None of them enjoyed the esteem and career security that makes possible reassessment and stylistic reflection. Unlike Stravinsky's, for example, the music of the atonalists had little autumnal evolution Berg and Webern didn't live long enough and Schoenberg, desperate for commissions, made only feints in new directions.
The Agriculture Department trimmed its estimate of the wheat harvest under way across the Southern Plains to account for drought damage, but recent rains have improved crop conditions in much of the Midwest. The department's June crop report, released Friday, predicted a 1.62 billion-bushel winter-wheat harvest, down 2 from the May forecast and down 5 from last year's actual harvest of 1.7 billion bushels. The damage isn't enough to fuel any acceleration in the nation's mild level of food-price inflation. U.S. wheat prices are depressed. Several of the U.S.'s wheat-exporting rivals, such as Australia and Canada, are sitting on large stockpiles in the wake of several good growing seasons. As a result, the Agriculture Department didn't change its forecast that the price of a bushel of U.S. wheat will average about 2.65 this year, give or take 25 cents. Many farmers can't make a profit at that price. Winter wheat, the biggest variety grown in the U.S., is planted in the fall and harvested in late spring. The wheat fields in the worst shape are located in Texas, where 59 of the crop is in very poor to poor condition, according to a government survey released a week ago.
NEW YORK -- The U.S. money-supply report will take yet another step into the shadows this summer. Beginning sometime around the first of August, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will start to phase out its weekly, in-person news briefing, where it has given out the weekly money-supply data for decades. It will be replaced with an electronic virtual news conference. For market players wanting to see the money-supply data, nothing is changing. At 430 p.m., the headlines will still scroll across trading screens. The report won't look any different than it did before. There won't be any new details. Even so, the change in the process signals just how far the money supply has fallen from its status as one of the pre-eminent economic indicators to one watched by a small audience of technically minded Federal Reserve watchers. The Fed may in fact be behind the curve most market veterans say it has been literally decades since the money-supply report captured their attention and had the ability to affect the direction of prices. The prime years of importance were between 1979 and 1982, says Marc Wanshel, an economist with J.P. Morgan. That is when the Federal Reserve was engaged in desperate combat to stomp out what seemed like an intractable inflationary spiral, he said.
NEW YORK -- The dollar looks poised to weaken somewhat this week, as the market turns its attention to the last big batch of data ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of the month. However, political events elsewhere could help the dollar, as Japan readies for its June 25 Lower House election and Europe grapples with economic reform. Analysts expect the dollar to trade in a range of 103 yen and 108 yen and near 96 cents against the euro. Many European markets are closed today for a holiday. Analysts expect more data indicating that the U.S. economy is slowing, which would feed speculation that the Fed will pass on raising interest rates at its June 27-28 meeting. The key data are retail sales and consumer prices, said John Rothfield, senior currency strategist at Bank of America in San Francisco. We expect those to be benign, and that will probably trigger a rally in some of the other currencies. The producer-price index for May, announced Friday, was unchanged, suggesting that consumer prices also will be benign and leaving an uncertain outlook for U.S. interest rates.
WASHINGTON -- Business groups are promising to wage a court battle over government regulations that would allow states to use unemployment-insurance money to give new parents paid time off from their jobs. The regulations, expected to be formally introduced today, would allow state governments to use unemployment-insurance funds to pay parents of newborn or adopted children while they are on leave from their jobs. A lawsuit challenging the rules is expected by the end of the week. The guidelines would amend 1993's Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows parents to take as much as 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for new children or sick relatives. White House officials say many Americans are simply unable to take such leave if it means doing without a regular paycheck. With jobs plentiful in a surging economy, the officials argue that excess unemployment-insurance funds can safely be shifted to pay for leaves. In today's strong economy, we can provide this important benefit without threatening the fiscal strength of the unemployment-insurance programs, said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. Nonsense, say many business groups, who accuse the White House of playing politics with money meant to provide a safety net for out-of-work Americans. They argue that the funds could run out if the economy were to slow, forcing companies to pay higher payroll taxes.

LONDON -- The London Stock Exchange is coming under increasing pressure to respond in detail to questions raised by critics of its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse AG. But exchange officials are warning that owners of the two exchanges may have to vote on the merger plan before many of the questions can be answered. The exchanges last month announced plans for a merger that would create a new pan-European exchange called iX and involve a joint venture with the U.S.-based Nasdaq Stock Market, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The agreement is subject to approval by owners of 75 of the shares in each exchange in votes expected to be held in September. Officials of the London exchange, known as the LSE, may have trouble winning enough votes from the 298 member firms that own the bourse. In early July, the two exchanges are due to give their owners an information memorandum on the deal, expected to be more than 100 pages long. Indications of its contents could be given to key London bankers tomorrow, when Werner Seifert, who is the chief executive of Deutsche Boerse and would hold the same post at iX, attends a meeting of an LSE committee that helps set trading rules. An LSE spokesman said the document will include projections for the prospects of iX but won't delve into issues beyond the exchanges' immediate control, such as regulation, settlement and the effect of the deal on stock indexes.
How do you translate synergy into French It's a nonsense word, and maybe it's a nonsense concept, too. But Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi, is betting his company on the dicey prospect that a transatlantic hodgepodge of European and American assets can indeed produce synergy--and make real money. Messier yesterday delivered the formal announcement of his 34 billion mega-deal to buy the Canadian drinks and entertainment company Seagram, which owns Universal studios and Polygram records. His hope is to make the merged Vivendi Universal into a Paris- based media company that will play in the same monster league with AOL-Time Warner. A comment by Messier at yesterday's press conference made it clear that one factor behind this deal is France's decades-old insecurity about the reach of America's cultural imperialism. For the first time in Europe, there is a communication group of a size that will be able to rival all the American giants, Messier boasted. Maybe so. But many a would-be entertainment baron has stumbled in the pursuit of Hollywood's irresistibly glamorous assets. Just ask the Japanese company Matsushita, which a decade ago was seduced into buying MCA, which it later sold in frustration to Seagram, which Seagram is now selling in frustration to Vivendi. When it comes to the entertainment business, it seems, there always is one more sucker. Even by recent standards of the merger-crazed business world, this one is a high-risk combination. It's premised on the belief that immense scale is essential to compete in today's economy. That remains a shaky proposition, in my book. Insiders say that even before the planned merger with AOL, Time Warner was an almost unmanageable collection of rival princes running their own fiefdoms. Add to that the difficulty of combining Paris and Hollywood--Gerard Depardieu and Julia Roberts--and you have a truly daunting challenge. The chance of the French succeeding in running a U.S. music and film business properly is about zero, one analyst told Reuters news service yesterday. The stock market certainly agrees with that gloomy assessment. Since news of the deal leaked last week, Vivendi's stock has fallen about 22 percent, including a 7 percent drop yesterday, according to the Associated Press. That drop reflects investors' doubts that Vivendi can make enough money from the deal to recover the premium it paid for Seagram, headed by Edgar Bronfman Jr.

Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged when they meet Tuesday and Wednesday, but they are also likely to say they are still more concerned about rising inflation than they are about signs the economy is slowing. The choice facing policymakers next week, Fed officials say, is between leaving their target for overnight interest rates unchanged or raising them by a quarter of a percentage point. A large majority of investors and analysts are betting rates will not change. The situation was very different when the central bank's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, last met in mid-May. Then, the choice was between raising the rate target by a quarter-point or a half-point. The policymakers opted for the latter, lifting it to 6.5 percent, a cumulative increase of 1.75 percentage points over a period of less than 11 months. But the statement issued at the end of next week's meeting undoubtedly will contain the same language as the one released last month Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. In other words, Fed officials see no reason yet to believe rates are necessarily high enough to slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay. They could well decide at the following meeting, Aug. 22, to raise rates again if new data indicate a rebound in growth.
NEW YORK -- When it comes to targeting consumers, an ax may work as well as an ad. A host of advertisers are investing in the Underhand Chop and the Single Buck -- two kinds of ax throws -- as well as target shooting, fishing and bird-fetching by teams of dogs, all in the hopes of luring the American public and its disposable income outside. The aforementioned contests are part of a new sports series titled The Great Outdoor Games, slated for broadcast on Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN cable sports network July 20-23. And they represent just one of the methods being utilized to prod sports nuts back to nature. It's the next Nascar, crows Jason Klein, the president and chief executive officer of Times Mirror Magazines, the newly acquired unit of Tribune Co., that publishes outdoorsy periodicals such as Outdoor Life and Field & Stream. The magazines are a partner in the upcoming sports program. With bass-fishing tournaments that feature boats decked out in corporate logos on the rise, his claim may be more than wishful thinking. This niche's consumers are taken for granted, says Jake Wienert, an executive director at ESPN. And yet the money spent in the industry flabbergasts me.
NEW YORK -- As technology stocks showed signs of recovery, with the Nasdaq Composite Index climbing back toward the 4000 level, bets on a pullback have increased. The level of short sales not yet closed out, known as short interest, on the Nasdaq Stock Market rose 1 to 2,808,345,712 shares on June 15 from 2,780,161,105 shares in mid-May, according to Nasdaq. The figures include Nasdaq small-capitalization and large-capitalization stocks. On the Nasdaq Small-Cap Market, which is made up of the 893 smaller-cap stocks, the number of short sales outstanding fell 16.9. It rose 1.5 for the 3,842 larger-cap stocks on the Nasdaq National Market. The figures suggest that investors are betting large-cap stocks have a greater chance of declining than small-caps. Short interest is often considered an indication of the level of skepticism in the market. Traders who sell securities short borrow shares and then sell them, betting they can profit by buying the stock back later at lower prices. Short interest reflects the number of shares that haven't been repurchased for return to lenders. Aside from making negative bets, investors may rely on short selling for other purposes, such as a hedging strategy related to corporate mergers and acquisitions, for convertible securities and options, and for tax purposes.
Executives at Burr-Brown Corp. sold 11.7 million of their Burr-Brown stock in the month before Texas Instruments Inc. announced it would acquire the computerchip maker for 7.6 billion in stock. Shares of the Tucson, Ariz., maker of analog chips used in camcorders, DVD players and hand-held computers, traded in a tight range from late March to early May, when the executives sold the shares. The May sales followed several months of insider sales. From May 11 to May 22, four BurrBrown executives, including Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Syrus Madavi, Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Wolf and Chief Financial Officer Scott Blouin, sold more than 180,000 shares in the 55 to 67 range. It's not unusual to see insider selling around a deal that doesn't carry much premium over the insider sale price, said Robert Gabele, director of insider research at First CallThomson Financial. What's unusual here is this insider selling occurred prior to a deal that resulted in a big premium. Burr-Brown declined to comment on the sales.
WASHINGTON -- Consumers are feeling somewhat less secure about the economy judging from June's drop in a key measure of consumer confidence. The nearly six-point decline in the Conference Board's monthly index of consumer sentiment, to 138.8 from a high of 144.7 in May, strengthens the widely held belief that the Federal Reserve Board won't raise interest rates today. As the Federal Open Market Committee enters its second day of meetings, its members should welcome a sign of waning consumer optimism. The May number, revised upward to 144.7 from a preliminary 144.4, equaled the record set in January. The index jumped seven points in May after moving up less than a point in April. We see a little slackening in expectations for businesses, said Lynn Franco, the economist who oversees the New York market research firm's survey of 5,000 households. Overall it's just basically a little bit of cooling, but not enough to slide into a recession. Historically, she said, June's 138.8 reading is very strong. Numerous reports in recent weeks, from construction to employment to consumer spending, have shown signs that the Fed's cycle of tightening may finally be reining in the galloping economy. It points toward a slowing economy but is not really alarming, said Ms. Franco.
Q The manager at the high-tech firm I work for is living with one of my co-workers. They like us to go drinking with them after work and have us socialize with them, with no distinction made between professional and private life. Resume-enhancing assignments, technical resources, training opportunities and phony sick days accrue to the favored colleague and those others who are willing to cater a social life for the happy couple. The rest of us get the leftovers and see clearly that if we don't participate outside of work, we are excluded from the inner circle. The manager and my co-worker appear to have simultaneous illnesses frequently, and work is not accomplished on time as a result. My manager's superior has been unofficially informed of this situation and appears willing to tolerate it. How, without ruining our own careers, can we get the company to fix this problem Should we just walk away, or do we owe it to the company to try harder A Office romances are a fact of modern life, with the workplace often acting as a kind of dating service for young men and women launching their adult lives. A 1994 report by the American Management Association, a human resources research organization, found that 79 percent of 485 managers surveyed said they had either been aware of or participated in an office romance. A parallel survey by the Society for Human Resource Management in 1998 found that many such romances resulted in marriage.
WASHINGTON -- Inflation is running higher than previously thought, even as more signs emerge that growth is slowing. The Commerce Department said the personal-consumption-expenditures price index rose 3.5 in the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, revised upward from a preliminary report of a 3.1 rise. The index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.5 in the 1999 fourth period. The department also said gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.5 in the first quarter, revised upward from an increase of 5.4. The fourth-quarter growth rate was a scorching 7.3. A separate department report showed that sales of new single-family homes fell again in May, another indication that the housing market may be softening after a series of interest-rate increases. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that the personal-consumption-expenditures price index is one of the best measures of inflation and is among those he watches most closely. The Fed's policy-making committee chose not to raise interest rates after its meeting Wednesday, although it released a statement citing heightened inflation pressure as cause for concern.
Computer Associates International taught investors an old, but important lesson yesterday Fourth of July firecrackers are best enjoyed when you are not holding them when they explode. The mainframe software firm lighted a fuse when it reported very late Monday night, actually just before midnight on July 4, that it would miss analysts' estimates for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30. It didn't provide full details in the late Monday announcement. This wasn't your ordinary, miss-the-estimates-by-a-penny-type announcement. Instead of earning the 55 cents that analysts expected, the Islandia, N.Y., company anticipated earnings of 11 to 16 cents, it later disclosed in a conference call yesterday morning. When the post-holiday markets finally opened, investors couldn't drop the stock fast enough. It plunged 43 to 29.375, down 21.75, in heavy 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading -- the largest percentage decliner on the Big Board. Wall Street was fuming. Indeed, the market carnage underscores the sensitive issue of trust between a company and Wall Street investors. Credibility can get a company through a rough patch, keeping investors from bailing out, limiting the damage to a stock price on bad news, and buying senior executives time from boards that look to the stock price as a report card for management. All that is blown when a company throws the Street a nasty curve.
MEXICO CITY -- A sharp increase in the number of U.S. visas granted to Mexican nationals will be a foreign-policy priority for incoming President Vicente Fox Quesada, according to a campaign working paper. The policy memorandum, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, says Mexico should consider negotiating a broad new immigration agreement with the U.S. The proposed plan would commit the U.S. to granting Mexicans many more visas in exchange for what would be unprecedented Mexican cooperation in reducing the northward flow of illegal immigrants. A U.S. State Department spokesman said any change in the number of Mexican immigrants allowed into the U.S. would have to be approved by Congress. Nevertheless, he said we look forward to working with Mr. Fox on the major issues of the relationship, especially immigration and economic issues. A top adviser to Mr. Fox says Mexico also should endorse a recent AFL-CIO initiative to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants living in the U.S. An estimated eight million Mexicans live in the U.S., with about half believed to have entered without documents. While many are able to legalize their status through marriage or other means, the number of undocumented arrivals is growing faster than ever -- about 300,000 this year. In comparison, the number of Mexicans entering with visas is small, about 70,000 a year, according to the adviser. Despite increased patrolling along the border, migrants keep crossing. Already this year, more than 100 migrants have died attempting to enter the U.S.
With the second-quarter earnings season almost here, optimism replaced pessimism and tech stocks resumed their rise. The Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by technology names, surged 2.52, or 97.47 points, to 3960.57, recovering most of Wednesday's 128.83-point loss. The index is again nearing the 4000 level that it briefly surpassed in June. More stocks rose than fell on the New York Stock Exchange. But Old Economy industrial stocks held the Dow Jones Industrial Average down. The average fell a scant 0.02, or 2.13 points, to 10481.47, in one of the smallest daily moves the blue-chip index has taken in recent years. Bonds fell and the dollar rose. Stocks have been held back by end-of-quarter earnings warnings from companies that will miss expectations, said Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. With the warning season ending, positive reports are set to begin.
JDS Uniphase Corp., an acquisitive fiber-optics concern, has reached an agreement to acquire rival SDL Inc. for about 41 billion in stock, a nearly 50 premium over SDL's closing stock price Friday. The boards of the two companies have approved the deal, in what is believed to be the biggest technology merger on record. JDS just completed the purchase of E-Tek Dynamics Inc. for 15 billion on June 30, and began discussions with SDL almost the day that the E-Tek deal closed, according to Jozef Straus, JDS Uniphase's co-chairman and chief executive officer. Donald Scifres, SDL's chief executive, will become co-chairman of the board with Mr. Straus and a board member of JDS Uniphase. Marty Kaplan remains chairman of JDS, and Mr. Straus will remain chief executive. The transaction values SDL's shares at 441.5125 a share, compared with Friday's closing stock price of 295.3125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Each share of SDL will be exchanged for 3.8 shares of JDS Uniphase. Shares of SDL were up 10.875, and climbed last week on some takeover speculation, as well as on expectations of strong financial performance. One reason why the price tag is so high is that Corning Inc., a rival fiber-optics concern, had been bidding for the San Jose, Calif.-based company as well, said one person familiar with the matter. The deal shows how major manufacturers are moving rapidly to team up so they can add capacity and develop higher-performing products to keep up with surging demand for fiber-optic equipment. In particular, Messrs. Straus and Scifres pointed to the desire by vendors to bring products to market quickly as a driving force behind the deal.
Corrections & Amplifications Contest Correction Because of a calculation error and the failure to take into account a stock split, this column selected the wrong winner in last month's stock-picking contest. The real winner Paul Zweng of Palo Alto Investors, whose selection, Palo Alto-based ClickAction, was the top-performing stock for the first six months of the year. After taking into account a 2-for-1 stock split in April, ClickAction posted a 17.4 gain for the period. Mr. Zweng, who was a good sport about the mistake, will return to compete in a future contest. WSJ -- August 16, 2000 Sometimes the best offense is a good defense. That was certainly the case in the latest round of Heard in California's semiannual stock-picking contest. The winner Scott Hood of First Wilshire Securities Management in Pasadena, whose pick -- East West Bancorp -- had the best showing during the six months ended July 5. The San Marino banking concern, chosen as a defensive play during a period of market volatility, was up 20, closing July 5 at 14.563. Mr. Hood's victory marked the first time since the contest started in January 1999 that a professional came out on top. In our contest, three pros compete against each other and a team of students who've won the latest round of a statewide stock-market game for school kids. Contestants pick a California company that they think will have the best return in six months.
It's not quite IPO Mania again, but . . . . With 18 initial public offerings of stock on this week's calendar, coming after several IPOs rallied smartly last week, it is clear that new issues are being sought after by investors again. This is good news for Wall Street investment bankers now sitting on a 45 billion backlog of pending new stock, the vast majority of them IPOs rather than follow-on deals by already-public companies. Shaking off the IPO slowdown caused by April's technology-stock plunge, investors are once again eager to snap up shares in fledgling companies. Most Wall Street firms have spent the past few days brushing the dust off IPOs that have been on the shelf. We're going to see a fairly healthy slug of new product hit the market over the next four to six weeks, predicts Tom Fox, head of equity capital markets at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. The window seems to be reopening. Yet despite the big crop of new issues on tap for this week-markets permittingthe IPO market isn't as frothy as it once was. For starters, investors, bruised from the spring's stock declines, remain wary of baby-faced companies looking for cash infusions at high valuations.
With high energy costs the main culprit, consumer price inflation, at least temporarily, is eating up the lion's share of the average American's annual increase in wages. The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent last month and 3.7 percent over the past 12 months, the fastest rate of increase since 1991, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Over the same period, average hourly wages for production and non- supervisory workers increased 3.6 percent, according to earlier department reports. Those figures include overtime pay but not bonuses or fringe benefits. Most analysts think this situation will be short-lived, because many energy prices appear close to a peak, the food and beverage prices rose only 0.1 percent last month, and the rest of the consumer price index--the core, which excludes both food and energy prices-- rose 0.2 percent for the third month in row. Since June 1999 the core CPI is up 2.4 percent, but it rose at a slower 2 percent rate in the past three months, the department said. On the energy front, there already has been some relief. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has proposed increasing production by 500,000 barrels daily but so far has not gotten agreement from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to do so.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys prices soared yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, said there are signs that economic growth is slowing to a more sustainable level. Investors wagered that his remarks mean there is less likelihood that Fed policy makers -- who meet again on Aug. 22 -- will raise interest rates again this summer. It was the best day for the bellwether 10-year Treasury in over a year, and the best performance for the 30-year bond since February. The 10-year Treasury note's price jumped 1 332 points, or 10.94 per 1,000 face value, to 103 1532. Its yield fell to 6.00 from 6.15 late Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year Treasury bond's price surged 1 1632 points its yield fell to 5.808 from 5.911 Wednesday.
The boards of both Deutsche Telekom AG and VoiceStream Wireless Corp. yesterday approved the German company's 50.5 billion stock-and-cash bid for the U.S. wireless concern, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed transaction, which also requires Deutsche Telekom to assume 5 billion of VoiceStream debt, would bring the booming wireless industry a step closer to seamless world-wide usage of cellular phones. The new company would have licenses to operate wireless networks that stretch from some of Europe's hottest markets to fast-growing U.S. wireless markets such as New York and California. The deal also forges the first wireless competitor that operates in both Europe and North America using a common digital standard called Global System for Mobile Communications -- paving the way for cell-phone customers to more easily use one phone all over the world. VoiceStream's major shareholders -- including Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Sonera Ltd. -- have also agreed to vote for the deal. In total, holders representing more than 50 of the shares outstanding are already in favor of the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Hutchison, which purchased its 23 stake starting in 1997 for 1.2 billion, stands to reap 11.6 billion. John Stanton, VoiceStream's chief executive, who owns six million shares, stands to reap about 1.1 billion. But the proposed deal faces growing opposition in Washington toward a foreign-government-backed telecommunications company owning a U.S. telecom concern. A bill introduced by Sen. Ernest Hollings D., S.C., seeks to block Deutsche Telekom from buying a U.S. phone company as long as the German government holds more than 25 of the company. Should the VoiceStream deal be completed, the German government's stake in the company would be diluted to 45 from 58. Deutsche Telekom hopes this will help appease concerns in Washington. Meanwhile, some Europeans see the Hollings initiative as a sign of U.S. protectionism. In recent days, European Union diplomats have said a U.S. move to block Deutsche Telekom from purchasing VoiceStream based on foreign-government holding could threaten existing trade agreements. German officials said they would almost certainly file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The transaction would also be subject to approval from the Federal Communications Commission.
When analysts surveyed the wasteland of oil-equipment and services companies in early 1999, they saw a sector littered with companies not only down but nearly out. Things were abnormally beat up, said Marshall Adkins of Raymond James & Associates, who took second place among stock pickers in the category in this year's Best on the Street Analysts Survey. There were fears in the marketplace that some of these companies wouldn't make it. Compounding those fears was an industry caught up in merger paralysis, with the big integrated oil companies focused on getting leaner at the expense of the new field development on which the service companies depend. So, after oil prices bottomed out in the spring, savvy analysts pounced on companies leveraged to North American natural-gas drilling, which is controlled by smaller independent companies that were more likely to put rigs back to work sooner. The reward triple-digit returns for several companies. We were surprised that the oil-price crash of 1998 lasted as long as it did, said Matt Conlan, 31 years old, of Prudential Securities, who took top honors among stock pickers in the category. The secret of his success We were very early to hop on the stocks that we thought would recover first and fastest and strongest.
Technology highflier JDS Uniphase Corp. has been gyrating even more than usual of late, and its frantic dance tells something about a nasty little problem that is beginning to affect more and more investors After more than 100 years of dealing with stock indexes, Wall Street still often can't revise an index without developing severe indigestion. Last week, it was announced that JDS Uniphase will enter the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index at today's close. The stock soared 26 on Nasdaq on Thursday and Friday. Then it fell 3.4 yesterday and Monday. If all goes as it usually does in such cases, the stock is likely to gyrate even more today, with a particularly big pop at day's end. These moves are caused by mutualfund and other portfolio managers seeking to mimic indexes even as other investors are trying to make money by anticipating such moves, and they can be disruptive. In December, Yahoo Inc. gained more than 63 in the week before it joined the S&P 500. In the following weeks, starting well before the rest of the market turned down, its stock price crumbled more than 50 it still isn't back to where it was when it joined the index, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is back to its December level. Even broader and, to some investors, more disturbing gyrations took place just last month. Hundreds of stocks were jolted on June 30 by seemingly innocuous changes in a variety of indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the S&P Barra growth and value indexes. With billions of dollars of shares changing hands on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, stocks that often don't move much in a month dropped 10 in a matter of minutes. Some investors felt they had been hit with a sucker punch.
The restless Joseph Galli is trading in books and compact disks for backhoes and organic brown rice syrup -- and a pay package estimated at around 25 million. After a tumultuous 13 months in the No. 2 spot at the consumer Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc., Mr. Galli is moving on to the job of chief executive at VerticalNet, a business-to-business online exchange based in Horsham, Pa. Mr. Galli, who was president and chief operating officer at Amazon, succeeds Mark Walsh, who will become VerticalNet's chairman. Mr. Galli's departure comes at a difficult time for Amazon. The Seattle-based online merchant has come under fire from Wall Street critics for its continuing losses, heavy debt load and dwindling cash reserves. While Amazon has said it has plenty of cash, the failure of a growing number of Internet retailers, including clothing retailer Boo.com Group Ltd. and toy seller Toysmart.com Inc., has reduced the patience of some investors. Amazon shares have fallen sharply from a 52-week high of 112.375. Yesterday, they traded at 37.625, down 1.125, as of 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Both Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, chairman and CEO, and Mr. Galli, who is 42 years old, put the best face on Mr. Galli's decision to leave. There are only good feelings between them, Mr. Bezos said. I was happy to be a good reference for Joe. Mr. Galli, for his part, said he relished the opportunity to become CEO of a high-flying Internet company and to be closer to his children, who live in Baltimore. Mr. Galli added that Amazon was a great adventure and that he learned a great deal from Mr. Bezos.
Here's how some major bills fared recently in Congress and how local congressional members voted, as provided by Thomas's Roll Call Report Syndicate. NV means Not Voting. The House approved a motion that had the effect of giving members of Congress a 2.7 percent pay increase, raising their salary to about 145,100 in January 2001. Had opponents of the pay raise won this vote, they would have offered a motion to kill the automatic cost-of-living adjustment COLA. They mounted this procedural attack after House leaders denied them debate and a direct, up- or-down vote on the merits of raising congressional pay. The vote occurred during debate on a Treasury Department funding bill for fiscal 2001 HR 4871. The House approved tax breaks to help individuals invest more of their earnings in Individual Retirement Accounts IRAs, 401k plans and other retirement vehicles. The bill HR 1102 is projected to cost the Treasury 52.2 billion over 10 years. It would raise the IRA contribution limit for individuals from 2,000 today to 3,000 in 2001, 4,000 in 2002 and 5,000 in 2003, and begin adjusting IRA contribution limits for inflation. For individuals older than 50, the new 5,000 limit would take effect as soon as the bill became law.
Ordinarily when Fannie Mae announces its quarterly earnings, chief financial officer Timothy Howard has a conference call with analysts and talks for the better part of an hour about the numbers that drive the performance of Washington's biggest business. Interest rate trends comprehensive net interest margins what it costs Fannie to borrow money, compared with what it costs the U.S. Treasury LIBOR rates T-bill spreads--it adds up to billions of dollars measured off in basis points, each of which is one one- hundredth of a percentage point. But this month, when Fannie put out its second-quarter financials, the conference call was dominated not by the jargon of Wall Street, but the spin control of Washington. Thomas E. Donilon, Fannie's executive vice president for law and policy, took over the teleconference and made a point of introducing Arne Christenson, senior vice president for regulatory policy. Christenson was, Donilon reminded the Wall Streeters, chief of staff to Newt Gingrich when he was House speaker. When your chief executive, Franklin Raines, used to be President Clinton's budget director and your vice chairman, Jamie Gorelick, is Clinton's former deputy attorney general, it's important for the politically naive numbers nerds on Wall Street to understand that you have a balanced offense. Because from that point on in the call, it was pure politics. We manage our political risk with the same intensity we manage our other risks, proclaimed Donilon, assuring investors they do not have to worry about all the bad things being said in Washington about Fannie Mae.
SUPPORTERS PUSH for legislation to reform unemployment insurance. It's late in the congressional session, but a group that includes business, state agencies and labor unions has reached a consensus on long-discussed unemployment-insurance reform. Their proposal would boost state unemployment funds, lower the corporate tax burden and extend benefits to part-time workers. We believe it's possible, says Rich Hobbie, unemployment-insurance director for the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies. The plan calls for tapping billions of dollars generated by a 0.2 payroll surtax that employers have paid since the 1970s. By 1987 the surtax had repaid the loans for which it was levied in the first place. But companies still pay, to the tune of 1.6 billion last year. Under the plan, the surtax would be repealed and state trust funds would receive 11 billion over six years. Part-timers would be eligible for unemployment compensation if they were laid off, and antiabuse measures would be beefed up. But the tax cut and a call to move the program to mandatory status, where it wouldn't compete with other programs for a share of the budget, may draw opposition. AT THIS WORKPLACE, a mental disability could be an advantage.
An attempt by the Clinton administration to establish government- paid leaves of absence for new parents is about to die a quiet death, rejected in every state legislature that took up the cause at the urging of the White House. Lawmakers in 15 states introduced legislation to use unemployment insurance trust funds--fattened by years of prosperity--to pay benefits for as much as 12 weeks of leave for working parents of newborns or adopted children. Clinton called on states last year to create the major new benefit, which the Republican-controlled Congress firmly opposed. The measures were introduced amid promises of reshaping the country's work and family policy to meet the needs of what is now a majority of families with two working parents. But one by one, the proposals died, stymied by business opposition and fears that unemployment insurance would run dry in a future recession. The last surviving bill, in Massachusetts, was buried in a study committee yesterday. Advocates there and in other states vow to try again next year, possibly creating a disability fund to pay for parental leave. The fate of the efforts reflects deep political resistance to using the fruits of economic prosperity to create new, ongoing government obligations--a vision advanced by Clinton and the presidential campaign of Vice President Gore.
When it comes to personal-income levels in Texas, the gap between the rich cities and the poor cities is continuing to widen. Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio registered the biggest gains in per capita income, while the border towns slowed sluggish increases. Per capita income growth is a key economic indicator. When incomes rise briskly, people have more money to spend on everything from restaurant food to housing. In Houston, personal income soared 5.8 in the first quarter over a year earlier as the city's economy rebounded from the low oil prices of 1999. Dallas, which wasn't particularly affected by low oil prices, still saw a strong 5.2 rise during the same period. And in Austin, the hottest economy of all in Texas, incomes gained 4.6 over a year earlier. San Antonio, long a bastion of stable growth, posted a 4 improvement. The strength in the state remains in those large cities, says economist Toni Horst of Economy.com formerly RFA Dismal Sciences Inc., West Chester, Pa., which compiles the data. That's where the growth is taking place. And that's where you're going to see the income growth. The bigger border cities didn't fare nearly as well. Even though most of them are growing rapidly, they aren't adding high-paying jobs like the big four Texas cities.
PHILADELPHIA -- When George W. Bush makes a warm-hearted appeal for support across the political spectrum in his acceptance speech tonight, he will sound compassionate. In other words, he'll sound a lot like Bill Clinton. But compassionate is only half of Mr. Bush's compassionate conservative formula. The conservative half has gotten far less attention here this week, and yet it forms the bedrock of the strategy that Bush advisers will pursue in search of victory in November. The strategy is based on a simple belief There are more conservatives than liberals in the American electorate, and nearly all of them now are Republicans. That's the legacy Ronald Reagan, who wrenched millions of conservatives from their ancestral Democratic homes, bequeathed to today's GOP. From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Bush's first priority has been to keep these conservatives content, and that will continue to be the case through the fall run toward the White House. Despite much advice to the contrary, candidate Bush has refused to shrink from his conservative positions. He's pushing a sweeping tax-cut plan, even though his congressional counterparts have retreated this year in favor of more modest cuts. He's offering a controversial proposal to partially privatize Social Security that many Republicans in Congress dare not touch. And he's resisting popular gun-control measures, despite fierce Democratic attacks. He also brushed off GOP moderates in selecting a solidly conservative, antiabortion running mate in Dick Cheney. The goal to nail down the two core elements of a winning coalition, a phalanx of Southern and Western states and white male voters nationwide. What's most striking about Mr. Bush's strategy is how it has diverged from the theories that many strategists advanced after the Republicans' electoral setbacks of 1996 and 1998. GOP leaders received plenty of advice to soften their conservative positions on issues such as tax cuts, abortion and gun control, even though such moves would anger the party's base. Mr. Clinton, for his part, used just such an approach to break his party's presidential losing streak in 1992, when he ran as a different kind of Democrat who pushed welfare and trade policies at odds with the Democrats' black and labor constituencies.
MADRID -- Spanish stock-market regulators formally opened an investigation of TXU Corp. of the U.S. and Electrabel SA, Belgium, as well as several executives, for allegedly violating Spanish takeover rules. The two companies are suspected of acting in concert last month when buying a combined 29 stake in Spanish power company Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico SA in the midst of a takeover battle for Spain's smallest utility. Spanish takeover rules require acquiring companies to launch a bid for 100 of the target company once a 25 stake is acquired. The Spanish Stock Market Commission, or CNMV, will draw up formal charges and take testimony from all three companies during the investigation, which could take months. Both companies' voting rights in Cantabrico have been suspended. If the two utilities are found to be in violation of Spanish securities law, they could face fines of as much as 50 million pesetas 275,200. The CNMV could also force the companies to launch a full takeover bid at 24 euros 21.98 a share, the price of the last, failed bid for Cantabrico. TXU Europe PLC Chairman Phil Tuberville denied any wrongdoing and promised to cooperate with the investigation. At the same time, he insisted that TXU would support any takeover bid of Cantabrico by another company. TXU and Electrabel set off the controversy by jointly acquiring some 15 of Cantabrico from two of its core shareholders, Banco Sabadell and savings bank La Caixa, in early July. In the deal, conducted by investment bank Lazard, TXU acquired an additional 5.25 of the Spanish utility, bringing its total stake to 19.25. Electrabel took a 10 stake in the same operation.
The Treasury Department announced yesterday that it will be able to pay down 221 billion worth of the publicly held national debt this year without further curtailing its scheduled auctions of new Treasury securities. Gary Gensler, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, told reporters that earlier cutbacks in the issuance of new securities and the department's planned buyback of 30 billion of older, high- yielding notes and bonds should allow the government to pay down the debt both this year and next. But by 2002, when the amount of older securities coming due will begin to drop substantially, additional reductions in auctions will be needed, he indicated. At the present time, we do not believe further changes in the overall pattern of our coupon debt issuance are necessary, he said. The price of the 30-year bond dropped on the news. It had climbed in recent trading because many economists and investors had expected the Treasury to say it will soon stop issuing the long bond, increasing the scarcity value of those remaining.
Switzerland's two biggest banks said today they had officially accepted an amended 1.25 billion settlement with victims of the Holocaust era. But Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG criticized new conditions that other Swiss companies and government bodies would have to follow to enjoy protection from future litigation. The banks said in a joint statement they had notified the responsible U.S. court in New York of their acceptance of the amendments relating to looted art, the further search for bank accounts, financing legal costs and the inclusion of insurance companies. But the banks said in reaction to a 55-page fairness ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman that they had not destroyed any documents to avoid honoring obligations. They also rejected suggestions that the total value of Holocaust accounts could be bigger than 1.25 billion. We want this criticism to be included in the protocol. But we are not going to do anything with it we accept the settlement and its content, a spokesman for Credit Suisse said.
The red-hot U.S. economy began showing more signs of slowing in the late spring and early summer, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday in its latest survey of business activity throughout the country. While the economy was in no danger of tipping into recession, the Fed survey found slower activity in consumer spending, manufacturing and construction in June and July. The conclusions were based on reports submitted by the Fed's 12 regional banks and intended for Fed policymakers to use when they next meet on Aug. 22. While economic growth accelerated in the spring, most analysts believe recent signs of a cool-down will persuade the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged at the August meeting. Over the past 14 months, the central bank has raised short-term interest rates six times in an effort to slow the economy enough to keep inflation under control, achieving what is often called a soft landing for the economy. The Fed's latest survey said, Economic activity in all Federal Reserve districts continued to expand in June and July, but there were additional signs the expansion was moderating in some sectors and the majority of districts.
Dell Computer Corp. said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 19, but revenue increased at the slowest rate in nearly six years. The biggest U.S. personal-computer maker reported net income for the quarter ended July 28 of 603 million, or 22 cents a diluted share, compared with 507 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. The results exceeded analysts' expectations of a 21-cent-a-share profit by a penny, according to First CallThomson Financial. The mixed results reflect slower growth in its desktop PC sales and Dell's growing reliance on sales of server computers for its revenue and profit. Server computers, which power Internet Web-sites, are growing faster and deliver higher margins than PCs due to their greater utility. Server computers are a relatively new business for Dell, but one growing faster than its traditional desktop PC business. It said unit sales rose just 22, compared with a 55 increase a year earlier. Higher server sales helped boost gross profit margins to 21.3 of revenue, from 20 in the year-earlier period. The margin improvement also reflected lower-than-expected component prices and burgeoning laptop PC sales, according to Dell Vice Chairman Kevin B. Rollins.
Washingtonians headed south this month, beware. The long, hot season of traffic congestion around Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens is in full swing. This year's tie-up has an interesting twist. A new Busch Gardens exit, including a bridge over Interstate 64, was supposed to open this summer but the project is a full year behind schedule. The exit will benefit tourists and residents by redirecting traffic from clogged roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation explains that its contractor faces a severe shortage of U.S.-made steel for the project. Federal Buy American laws forbid interstate highway projects with federal financing from using imported steel, even if there is no domestic steel available. The restrictions apply equally to the raw material rolled beam or the fabricated product finished girders. A Northern Virginia contractor with whom I spoke said his supplier could use imported rolled beam for the contractor's private projects, but for federal roads projects such as the Interstate 95 exchange at Springfield, the domestic raw material costing 15 to 30 percent more was required. By expensively micromanaging his projects, his firm has steel. Others are scrambling. Guess who ultimately pays the extra cost. Buy American policies are nothing new, and they have a patriotic plausibility to most people. Who could be against saving American jobs In many circumstances they are also innocuous. On the other hand, if they squeeze out imports as intended, they maintain higher prices to American steel users or cause them production delays waiting for backlogged orders to clear. This may save some jobs in favored industries like steel, but at a cost of sales and jobs in American industries that use steel. The benefits this policy provides to the protected steel workers and shareholders come directly out of the pockets of other Americans. This is income redistribution of the worst sort--from average folks to a group that earns substantially more than the manufacturing mean wage. In times of high unemployment, Buy American provisions conceivably can raise domestic demand, thus cushioning a cyclical downturn. But these discriminatory policies are hopelessly inefficient compared with Alan Greenspan's well-oiled monetary policy machine. By the way, has anyone checked the unemployment rate lately What many people do not realize is that the most intense competition American firms face is not with foreign firms but with other American firms in markets for talented labor and scarce capital. Any policy that favors one set of American industries disfavors others. The most important possible exception to this is for policies that are designed to enhance innovation in ways that spill over to other American firms. Buy American policies are not directed toward research and development, and the steel industry is not at the cutting edge of technical progress. Highway construction contractors happily use Komatsu earth-moving equipment and a host of other imported products. So why is USX favored and Caterpillar not The answer, of course, is lobbying power. A large industry spread across a number of important states often gets its way. Alas for the steel industry, its influence isn't what it used to be. The industry employs more than 400,000 fewer workers than it did in 1960. Small, modern mini-mills now provide almost half of domestic output. They have production costs substantially lower than the remaining large-scale integrated mills for which steel protectionism was designed.
Stocks rose today as blue chips surged on encouraging economic data, but concerns about a second-half earnings slowdown kept technology stocks from broader gains. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 119.04 points higher at 11,027.80, marking the first time since April 25 that the blue-chip index has finished above 11,000. Today's surge gave the Dow a gain of 260.05 for the week. Broader indicators also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.59 at 1471.84, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 29.48, to 3789.47, having recovered from a decline of 60 points earlier in the session. The S&P was up 8.91 for the week, while the Nasdaq eked out a gain of 2.11. Analysts said a pattern has emerged recently in which investors react to whatever news is released on a given day, causing markets to fluctuate from session to session. Today, for instance, investors in blue chips were encouraged by a Labor Department report that showed wholesale prices were virtually unchanged in July after a large increase in June. The turnabout in the producer price index was the result of a big swing in gasoline and other energy costs.
First Union, taking steps to reverse two years of profit declines, said it will sell its credit-card business to MBNA and take a 1 billion pretax gain as a result. Charlotte-based First Union, which said it will sell more than 3 million accounts and 5.5 billion of loans to MBNA, declined to disclose how much MBNA will pay. First Union also informed the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it may cut as many as 5,291 jobs, double the number it had mentioned in June. The Nasdaq Stock Market said it is continuing to halt trading of Value America shares. Trading in the Charlottesville-based company's stock was halted at 403 p.m. Friday at a last sale price of 71 78 cents a share. Trading will remain halted until Value America has fully satisfied Nasdaq's request for additional information, the Nasdaq said. At the time of Friday's halt in trading, Value America, a pioneer in Internet retailing, announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. The company also halted its electronic retailing operations, shut down its Web site and fired 185 employees. Gasoline prices have fallen an average of 7.48 cents a gallon nationwide in the past three weeks, to 1.53, continuing their decline after record highs in some areas in June. The slide began after suppliers rushed gasoline to the Midwest to solve distribution problems in the region, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. Prices in Chicago have fallen 17 cents over the last survey period, 13 cents in Cincinnati and 31 cents in Detroit. The national average price of gas has fallen 18 cents since June 23, when it reached a high of 1.7134. Declines occurred in every region of the country. Agilent Technologies, which warned last month that its fiscal third-quarter profit would not meet analysts' expectations, said it will fire about 650 workers at its health-care unit to cut costs. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of testing and measurement instruments will cut about 450 full-time employees, equal to 9 percent of its full-time health-care work force or about 1 percent of its total staff. It also will fire about 200 of its 350 contract workers, a spokeswoman said. Chiron, the world's largest maker of a medicine for kidney and skin cancer, said it will buy PathoGenesis for about 700 million in cash, giving Chiron a drug for cystic fibrosis. PathoGenesis's TOBI, an inhaled antibiotic that is used by cystic fibrosis patients, accounted for 60 million of the company's 60.8 million in 1999 sales.
WASHINGTON -- Industrial output rose sharply last month as a resurgent manufacturing sector offset steep declines in production by the nation's utilities and car makers. The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose by 0.4 in July, double its 0.2 gain in the previous month. The increase was in line with market expectations and brought the index 5.8 higher than its level a year earlier. The nation's factories, meanwhile, were operating at 82.3 of capacity in July, a notch higher than the 82.2 level recorded in June. Many analysts believe that plants can operate at as much as 84 of capacity before production bottlenecks develop, raising risks of inflation as companies increase prices to offset the costs of bringing new plants into operation to ease delays. The numbers point to continued strength in the manufacturing sector, the biggest component of the industrial-output measure. Manufacturing output rose by 0.5 and is now 6.8 stronger than year-earlier levels. In June, output rose 0.4 and was 6.4 higher year over year. The July increase came despite a 5.5 drop in motor-vehicle production as car and truck manufacturers began retooling factories for new product lines. Excluding the vehicle sector, manufacturing output rose 0.9, its sharpest gain since October.
Whenever Nancy Lloyd comes face-to-face with consumers, they often ask the same question How do I pay off my credit cards as quickly and inexpensively as possible Most people get this wrong, says Lloyd, the local author of Simple Money Solutions 10 Ways You Can Stop Feeling Overwhelmed by Money and Start Making It Work for You Times Books, 23, but the rules keep changing, so I can't really blame them. Lloyd rarely blames consumers for their financial pitfalls and pratfalls.. The former Federal Reserve Board economist knows firsthand how easy making wrong money decisions can be, whether paying off credit cards, purchasing a new car or buying life insurance. That's why her new how-to book, which addresses those kinds of everyday and sometimes complex money issues, starts paying dividends from the first chapter on ending money yo-yo diets to the Time-Is-Money Calendar in the appendix. I always approach these problems as if I had to make the decision What do I need to know and how do I do it says Lloyd, who started tracking money issues 10 years ago in The Washington Post's Style Plus pages and since has been a contributing editor for Family Circle magazine, a money adviser for CBS News and ABC News, and National Public Radio commentator. Despite impressive credentials, Lloyd is no windbag. Simple Money Solutions proves to be exactly that--simple. A lot of the books try to show everybody how much they know about money and they use phenomenally big words, she says. I wanted to present it in a way you could just pick it up anywhere and follow the advice. Indeed, the book is driven by mistakes Lloyd or people she knows unwittingly made. In a lot of these financial issues, she says, people don't know what questions to ask until after something's gone wrong.
WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices rose modestly last month and construction of new homes fell, further suggesting that Federal Reserve policy makers won't raise interest rates at their meeting next week. The Labor Department said the consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 in July, compared with a sharper increase of 0.6 the previous month. Steady prices in the energy sector were responsible for the moderation. Energy prices rose just 0.1 last month, compared with a 5.6 jump in June. Meanwhile, housing starts fell for the third month in a row, dropping 3.3 in July, compared with a 1.8 drop in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.51 million, the Commerce Department said in a separate report. The figures suggest a sustained cooling in the market for new homes. Yesterday's reports provided the last important data before the Fed's rate-setting meeting, scheduled to begin on Tuesday. With the mild inflation picture and the home-building slowdown, market expectations that the Fed will leave its target for the federal-funds rate unchanged look like a safe bet. The federal-funds rate governs overnight loans between banks. The housing-start number will reinforce the view that we're starting to head into a slower period of growth in the economy, said Mike Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. I would view it as the type of news that will keep the Fed on the sidelines.
Firestone's top executive said the company realized there were problems with the treads on its Wilderness AT tires under severe conditions and moved to improve that model before it announced the recall of 6.5 million of its ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires. Masatoshi Ono, chief executive of BridgestoneFirestone Inc., said in an interview that Firestone had implemented measures to improve the performance of the Wilderness tires before the recall. Mr. Ono said the tire maker began to make those improvements when it realized the treads could separate under severe conditions, such as high-speed driving in sweltering heat with underinflated tires. Mr. Ono also conceded that Firestone and Ford Motor Co. had disagreed over proper tire-inflation levels. Yesterday, BridgestoneFirestone was forced to make a major concession aimed at accelerating the process of replacing the millions of recalled tires. It said it would extend indefinitely its reimbursement policy after a Kentucky judge slapped the company with a temporary restraining order requiring it to continue reimbursing owners of recalled tires who have them replaced with a competitor's brand someplace other than at one of the company's designated outlets. Rep. John Dingell D., Mich. had also written to the company expressing concern that Firestone customers wouldn't be able to replace tires quickly enough.
Technology stalwarts drifted higher on positive earnings prospects but Old Economy blue chips fell and bonds lost ground, as volumes remained at low summertime levels. The dollar, meanwhile, strengthened, particularly against the euro, as the European common currency again fell close to its all-time low. Battered by inflation fears, the euro fell to 89.28 cents from Monday's 90.08 cents, near the low of 88.45 cents set in May. On the stock front, some technology and Nasdaq investors said the market will likely see a strong rally after Labor Day, because the specter of interest-rate increases has largely dissipated. Others are eagerly counting down to third-quarter earnings reports. But at least during yesterday's session, tech optimism, and a boost to financial stocks from acquisition reports surrounding Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, weren't enough to offset weakness in other sectors.
NEW YORK -- Many options traders were reluctant to take advantage of puts and calls whose prices have been discounted ahead of the Labor Day weekend. With the financial markets closed Monday in observance of the holiday, specialists are lowering volatility -- an important part of an options price -- to attract buyers. A broad barometer of options prices, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, declined 0.31 to 19.28, a level that is widely regarded as indicating that prices are cheap. Specialists hope discounted prices will persuade traders to buy their options, which would transfer time decay off their trading sheets. Time decay is the amount of money an options contract loses each day as it approaches expiration.
WASHINGTON -- Facing intense pressure from cancer doctors and some members of Congress, the Clinton administration will put off plans to reduce payments for cancer and hemophilia drugs, officials said. In June, the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said that beginning this fall it would reduce overpayments for about 50 drugs, including those used to treat respiratory disease. But the agency now plans to announce that it won't reduce its payments for cancer and hemophilia drugs anytime soon and instead will study the issue further. It isn't clear exactly how many drugs will be affected. About one-third of the 50 drugs are chemotherapy drugs. However, many of the others are used in conjunction with cancer therapy. The agency's decision is a big victory for the cancer doctors, a politically powerful group represented by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Throughout the summer, cancer specialists and patient advocates have mounted an aggressive campaign to derail the payment reductions. The physicians, sometimes accompanied by patients, argued in Congress that they wouldn't be able to afford to administer chemotherapy in their offices if the price cuts went into effect. The doctors concede that Medicare reimbursements for cancer drugs may be inflated, but they say they need the higher reimbursements to offset sharp underpayments for administering chemotherapy. The doctors want any changes in drug reimbursements delayed until payments for other expenses are increased.
For a growing number of affluent families, Dad now earns so much that it doesn't pay for Mom to work. But as Nancy Ann Jeffrey finds, this return to traditionalism comes with some very modern stresses. David and Lisa Keyko were the classic high-powered two-career couple. He was a commercial litigator. She was a director at a design firm. They split the grocery-shopping and cleaning, left their kids with a babysitter and came home exhausted almost every night. But take a look at the Keyko family today Mr. Keyko is still a lawyer, but his income has doubled, allowing his wife to take up a whole new profession housewife. Most weekdays, he's at the office until 9 p.m., while she carts the kids around, volunteers at school and tries to have dinner waiting when her husband comes home. It's ended up being sort of traditional, says Mr. Keyko. Make way for Leave It to Beaver -- 2000. For a surprising number of couples, the New Economy has meant a return to the Old Family, with Dad as sole breadwinner. It's one of the most peculiar twists to the decade-long boom Couples who used to be economic equals have found that one partner's income -- usually the man's -- has soared so much that it hardly makes sense for both spouses to work. Indeed, while the percentage of single-income households has remained steady for Americans overall, it has moved up considerably for affluent families who earn 250,000 or more a year. But the change has also introduced some frictions that Beaver Cleaver's family couldn't have imagined. Besides the usual struggle over sacrificing career goals, some of these moms say they're astonished by just how traditional their roles have become, not just focusing on children but in some ways living vicariously through their husband's careers.
CHICAGO -- One of the Federal Reserve's leading New Economy advocates said in an interview that interest rates could soon start heading lower. Once we get over the energy hump, I wouldn't be surprised if inflation declines and interest rates are going to come down, Robert McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said after his speech at the National Association for Business Economics conference here. He said market rates, such as the 10-year Treasury note, would be the first to fall. The federal-funds rate probably won't lead market rates down but eventually will follow. Mr. McTeer's remarks suggest that, aside from support inside the central bank for ending the recent rate-raising campaign, there is even some talk of moving to ease monetary policy. Some economists have suggested that the next Fed move would be an easing but that it wouldn't happen for several months or even well into next year. Behind that talk of an easing are expectations that inflation will ease once oil prices, which rose 1.51 yesterday to 35.14 a barrel, begin to decline. The federal-funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending, is currently set at 6.5. But the 10-year Treasury yield, despite rising Monday, remains well below at 5.76.
Ending a turf battle that has lasted nearly two decades, financial market regulators yesterday reached an agreement that clears the way for investors to buy futures contracts based on single stocks. The agreement still faces scrutiny from Congress. But lawmakers have told the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that if they could settle their dispute, Congress would likely adopt their approach. The deal, in which the two have essentially agreed to share regulatory oversight, paves the way to end an 18-year ban on single-stock futures. A futures contract is a promise to deliver or to buy at a set date in the future and at a set price a certain item--pounds of coffee, barrels of oil, or, in this case, stocks or bonds. By law, a futures contract must be traded on an exchange. Once the ban on single-stock futures is lifted, investors could, for example, sell a futures contract based on shares of International Business Machines Corp. to hedge against a decline in the price of the company's stock, or buy such a contract instead of buying the actual IBM shares. Single-stock futures could lower investors' risk by allowing them to hedge against price changes in stocks and bonds. But because they also carry lower margin requirements, similar to those on options contracts, many experts say they could be riskier for many consumers. Initially institutional investors and businesses are expected to be the biggest customers for these new products.
Gaining the confidence of Wall Street can be hard for a company. But regaining the Street's confidence after losing it can be even harder. Take health-care information provider IMS Health. It delivers information on drug sales and trends to pharmaceutical giants, with an amazing 93 market share. But some investors and analysts are reluctant to give the company a clean bill of health because of management-credibility issues. Concerns stem from the odd reverse merger IMS announced this past March with TriZetto, a three-year-old Internet health-care concern with a mere 33 million in annual revenue. Investors couldn't grasp why the venerable information provider -- with 1.4 billion in annual revenue last year -- was looking to merge with the newly public company, which offers medical billing and administrative software online. Amid the pummeling of both companies' shares, the deal was subsequently scratched, although IMS ended up selling a unit to TriZetto. The company's shares have been given a 5 management discount by Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Stephen DeNelsky. He has prepared an interactive stock-valuation spreadsheet for investors in which they choose how much of a discount they want to apply. It's the risk that when you walk in one morning and boot up your machine that there is another news item with something like the TriZetto deal, Mr. DeNelsky says of the discount. For their part, IMS's top executives continue to defend the deal, believing it would help IMS to expand its Internet strategy. From a strategic point of view, it was a good transaction from a timing point of view, we couldn't have picked a worst time because we did announce it simultaneous with the collapse of the technology market, Robert E. Weissman, the company's chairman, says in an interview, referring to the spring collapse in tech shares. We were not tone deaf in spite of the fact that we did not need shareholder approval. We listened and we modified the transaction.
PRAGUE -- For the second day in a row, a top International Monetary Fund official put public pressure on the world's big economies to intervene to support the plunging euro, but there were no signs that the U.S. is prepared to join such an effort. Calling the euro heavily undervalued, the IMF's new managing director, Horst Koehler, told reporters it is clear that intervention cannot be taboo, because it is part of the instruments any central bank or government has available. The day before, the IMF's chief economist, Michael Mussa, said the conditions ripe for coordinated intervention are rare and added, One has to ask, If not now, when'  The unusually blunt comments from the IMF officials sparked speculation in financial markets that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven big industrialized nations, who are to meet here Saturday, may be preparing to step up the rhetoric about the euro or agree on joint intervention. But the common currency fell to a new intraday low against the dollar of 84.38 cents, suggesting the markets weren't counting on intervention. The euro, born at 1.17 in January 1999, was trading late yesterday in New York at 84.83 cents, down from 85.09 cents Tuesday. The conventional wisdom about currency-market intervention, particularly among U.S. officials, is that it is most likely to succeed when it is coordinated among big economies, announced publicly and catches the markets by surprise. Although G-7 officials appear to agree that the euro is oversold, and by implication that the dollar is unsustainably high, widespread expectations about intervention offer an argument to delay rather than to act now.
Phyllis D. Rose spends up to 90 minutes each weekday in her car, driving to and from the General Services Administration's offices in Arlington where she works. And when she gets there, after the traffic-filled ride from her home in Laurel, Rose typically gets interrupted many times over by bosses, colleagues and the telephone. The distractions are many the opportunities to concentrate are few. But things are a lot calmer on the days she reports to the Laurel Telecommuting Center--a mere five-minute drive from her house. Away from the interruptions of her workplace, she finds she is far more efficient and gets much more done. Rose is one of 27 federal workers signed up to telecommute part of the week from the telecommuting center in Laurel, which opened almost a year ago. The center is part of a federal program and one of three pilot projects run by the College of Southern Maryland in La Plata. There are now 17 such telecommuting centers in the Washington area and about 27 around the country, all of which are nonprofit projects started in 1994 and funded by the General Services Administration GSA. Each federal agency also has 50,000 set aside in its annual budgets to contribute to the centers, if employees use them.
On Sunday in Miami, the Baltimore Ravens finally got more than just a glimpse of running back Jamal Lewis's potential. And now that his potential has turned into productivity, Lewis will be playing a bigger role in the offense. Coach Brian Billick said this week that Lewis, who is 5 feet 11 and 231 pounds, will become the Ravens' primary ball carrier, which is exactly what the team anticipated when it used the No. 5 overall draft pick on him in April. You can see what he brings to the offense, the combination of power, explosion, all the things we've talked about since we drafted him, Billick said. The thing he gives you is the potential for the big play. Lewis, who made his first NFL start in Miami, led the team in rushing with nine carries for 76 yards and had the biggest play on offense against the Dolphins. Late in the second quarter, Lewis ran off left guard and broke free for a 45-yard gain. As he sprinted down the sideline, Lewis shrugged off three tackles before being tripped up and pushed out of bounds. Although that was his longest run of the game, Lewis was equally impressive the times he carried the ball much shorter distances.
Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls Big-time U, the large public university with high- profile football andor men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels. At many of these institutions, he argues, beer-and- circus--the party scene connected to big-time college sports events-- replaces meaningful undergraduate education. The case he marshals against these places--schools scarcely seems the right word--is overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of higher education in America. Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athletics--Sperber calls Florida State University the national champs of beer and circus, and with ample reason--but it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important. Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him in a previous book, College Sports, Inc. and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, just another number, rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load. Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities and some of the private ones as well are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world. A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni and anyone else who would listen that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News that ambition seems to be universal. But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. In the 1980s, Sperber writes, some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.
John Vernon thinks of it as his Captain Kirk moment. The president of consulting firm Approach Inc. stood in front of the six-pack of cubicles outside his office one day and realized that office space is the final frontier for boosting productivity. His vision a sleek space allowing his information-technology consulting teams to serve clients at warp speed. His company's office in Valhalla, N.Y., had more in common with the cube farms of Dilbert cartoon fame. The offices were on the exterior of the floor, and I had the corner office, of course, because I was the president, the 38-year-old Texas native says sheepishly. Everybody else was in a cubicle. If his firm of 60 employees was going to keep increasing revenue at more than 50 a year, he decided, the space needed to reflect the way his company actually did business. Fast-forward two years to today. Poorly designed cubicles and window-hogging offices are history. In their place is a work space defined by vertical black-metal supports and clusters of glass-walled conference rooms, desktops with low-rise dividers and tables. Laptops and flat-panel computer screens are scattered across work surfaces, which can be quickly reconfigured. Copiers and such are a few steps away, not down the hall and take the second right. People used to play phone tag or wander around the office to set up meetings, Mr. Vernon says. Now three guys working in the same area can just wheel their chairs around a computer terminal. As a result, Approach is getting its high-margin product -- client proposals -- to market at least 20 faster than before. We think a significant portion of this improved performance is directly attributable to our new office space, Mr. Vernon says.
Traditionally, when we all think of work, we picture an office. With a boss. And co-workers. We have to dress a certain way, and worry that if someone sees us leaving early, they'll label us Slacker- Extraordinaire. But what about those free agents out there The ones who break away from the traditional office scene to freelance or consult There are many things to consider if you're pondering a life of working at least part-time in your pajamas. First of all, do you have the experience necessary to know what you're doing Have you spent enough years in the industry to have a couple of contacts you can hit up for some work Do you have a little bit of money saved up to cover the rent until that first payment comes in Flying solo can be an awesome experience, but it can also be a ponderous task if you haven't prepared yourself or don't know how to navigate. Susan Schulz was a 28-year-old editor at YM Magazine in New York about eight months ago, when she decided to jump ship and move into the dot-com world with a start-up. On her first day at the new company, she was told the company's funding fell through and she'd have to be let go, along with just about everyone else. Horrified, she went home and started calling a few contacts she had in the magazine industry to ask if they knew of any job openings. They didn't, but they did know of some freelance opportunities. So she ran with that, assuming she could freelance a few articles while looking for a more stable job.
Place kicker Michael Husted clearly had breathed a healthy sigh of relief when the gun sounded to signal the end of the Redskins' 16-6 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday night. He knew full well that missing an extra point and 30-yard field goal in the second half could have led to disaster for his new team, not to mention swift NFL unemployment. For now, Husted has job security for at least another week, according to team sources, but the Redskins are planning to bring in free agent Jaret Holmes for a look this week, just in case Husted has further problems. Holmes, 24, has had practice-squad stints with the Bears and Giants, played in the NFL's European league this past season and was in Chicago's training camp last summer before being cut prior to the season. Husted, an eight-year NFL veteran, was added to the Redskins' roster the same day as the team's Monday night loss to the Cowboys last week. He signed when regular kicker Brett Conway continued to have problems with a quadriceps injury in his kicking leg. Husted said he did not want to make excuses for his two misses against the Giants and, that after looking at film, he said he had come in too tight to the ball and kept my hips open. I don't think I was consciously worried about the footing, but I'm sure the footing had something to do with it. New turf was installed last week at Giants Stadium, and a number of players reported having problems on the grass surface.
PRAGUE -- After five months in office, International Monetary Fund chief Horst Koehler has begun to win over many of those who wondered whether he was up to leading the global lender through a period of public excoriation and internal reform. As thousands of antiglobalization protesters laid siege to the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank here yesterday, Mr. Koehler laid out his vision for the agency responsible for rushing in with big loans and stern advice when a developing nation finds itself in financial crisis. The IMF, Mr. Koehler told top officials from 182 member nations, must make globalization work for the benefit of all. His effort to focus the IMF on emergency loans for better-off developing countries, and on poverty reduction and debt relief for the worst-off, won't convince the IMF's harshest critics, who believe its economic prescriptions favor corporations over the poor and the environment. But his approach is securing him the grudging cooperation of some outside activists and so far, so good kudos from member governments, large and small. The Clinton administration likes his embrace of many of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's reform proposals. The British praise his ability to talk debt relief with antipoverty advocates. The Yemenis applaud when he prods rich countries to open their markets to exports from the developing world. These aren't necessarily the reviews that Mr. Koehler, 57 years old, might have expected. His appointment came after a bitter trans-Atlantic clash. Now, however, Clinton administration officials are warming to Mr. Koehler, who has endorsed many of the IMF reform proposals that Mr. Summers himself first put forth, such as the focus on crisis finance. Just last week the IMF board redesigned its lending programs -- shorter terms and higher rates -- to encourage countries such as Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia to borrow only when they're locked out of private capital markets. Preapproved credit lines are available to countries whose economic policies are judged sound but that might still be hit by contagious market panic.
Big government is about to get bigger, despite the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates' pledges to the contrary, according to a new report. After years of downsizing, the number of people directly or indirectly employed by the federal government could grow by about 1 million to reach 18 million over the next five to 10 years, according to Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution. Directly or indirectly responsible for about one-eighth of the jobs in the nation's economy, the government now is poised to expand, no matter whether the electorate chooses George W. Bush or Al Gore as the next president, Light writes in an article in the October issue of Government Executive. According to Light, promises by candidates Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. Bush on defense spending, prescription drug coverage and education will lead to increased staff numbers. Both candidates are making promises that can only be kept by adding to the true size of government, as measured not only by the size of the federal civil service but by the number of employees working indirectly for Uncle Sam under contracts and grants, Light says. Excluding state and local jobs mandated by the federal government, which Light sometimes includes in his numbers, the size of the federal government last year was down nearly 1 million jobs from the beginning of the Clinton administration in 1993. Light has contended previously, and continues to do so in the October article, that the true federal work force includes not just civil service employees but also postal workers, contract workers and grantees, as well as the state and local employees whose work is mandated by the federal government. All of these workers are needed to deliver the federal mission, Light states.
A problem involving rents paid for apartments and houses caused the government to slightly understate the rate of consumer price inflation for the first eight months of the year, officials said yesterday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday revised its monthly figures for the consumer price index to correct the problem, raising the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.5 percent on an annual basis, for the January through August period. The rate for the so-called core portion of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also lifted by the same amount, to 2.7 percent. Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of labor statistics, said at a press briefing the problem first arose in January 1999 when the agency began using a significantly different sample of housing units to collect rent information. However, she said, the CPI figures for 1999 were not revised because the agency decided the changes were too small to warrant all the problems such a revision would cause for everyone who uses the CPI to adjust benefits, pay, rents and even parts of the tax code for inflation. It would be enormously disruptive for the whole gamut of users of this information if the 1999 figures had been revised, Abraham said, adding that her agency's guidelines for such matters say we should not be revising too far back in time. The agency will not know until next month, when it has the September price figures, whether the changes announced yesterday will affect next year's cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and federal pensions. Those benefits are raised each January according to the increase in the average level of the CPI in the July through September period from the level in the same three months of the preceding year.
CORRECTIONS The name of Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, was misspelled in a story on globalization in the Oct. 1 Business section. Published 10062000 It may be only a slight exaggeration to say that nobody has profited more from globalization than George Soros, who made billions speculating in financial markets around the world, in some cases bringing entire national economies to their knees. But there he was last week, standing among top financiers from Citicorp and Deutsche Bank, in a magnificent rococo ballroom of the old Hapsburg palace here, denouncing the excesses of the new global economy. It is in our enlightened self-interest to make sure that the losers in this global system--and right now there are billions of them--get a chance to participate, he said between bites of a tangy chicken goulash. Why Because otherwise the people who are disadvantaged will use their political clout to capture the system. Two days later, much the same warning was delivered by a young, multi-pierced anarchist as he hurled a cobblestone at the head of a Czech riot policeman guarding the entrance to the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. On a nearby building, one of his comrades had scrawled, Kill Capitalism Before Capitalism Kills Us.
Al Gore's campaign headquarters is swamped in suggestions about how he should behave in the first, crucial debate Tuesday in Boston. By fax, tape and letter, advice is pouring in. The gist of it Be nice--don't try to make Bush look stupid. George W. Bush's unsolicited kibitzers are telling him to search for a crushingly simple one-liner like the immortal There you go again that Ronald Reagan used against Jimmy Carter in '80. There is a push on the agenda, too. Hundreds of citizens are pelting moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS with ideas. One issue needs no champions. It has elbowed its way to the top. You have only to hear Republican candidates voicing their support for a Democratic prescription drug bill that they once voted against to realize what a headache seniors' pills are giving the GOP this fall. Says House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, At every stop, it comes up--not just from seniors, but from boomers who take care of their parents. Erik Smith, communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says that in the two dozen hottest races, prescription drugs is at or near the top.
The last two of seven HMOs will close at the end of the year, according to Thursday's paper Extra, Sept. 28. About 1,000 people out in the cold for insurance coverage. Of the original seven HMOs in Charles County, averaging about 500 per company, that is about 4,000 people that have been left with no medical or drug coverage. Yesterday on a television morning show a lady 79 years old was explaining to the television host how she spent two to three hours a day collecting aluminum cans for 5 cents apiece in order to supplement her monthly income to eat something besides the oatmeal she eats every day. Her monthly annuity is 800 and her medical bill is 300 a month plus. So she must collect cans. Now here is a 79-year-old lady who stands a chance of being mugged in some alley. She has put aside her dignity and pride to survive. I wonder how many Congress people would like their mother, brother, sister or son to be exposed to the same thing At the same time our Congress is on the Hill playing partisan games with legislation that might help us while we suffer. Folks, we have got to do something for ourselves. Most of us are too old I'm 80 to walk protesting picket lines, and we do not have money to have elaborate protest signs printed. So all we have is our vote. On Nov. 7, vote. We can be vicious. We can be mean. Or we can be kind and fair. But we can also be judgmental by the use of our X in the voting booth. Put it in the right place.
The Washington area's economy has been swimming upstream for many months against the currents of higher interest rates, a volatile stock market and rising fuel prices. But so far the region's economy has kept its head up, with the latest jobs reports showing only small increases in unemployment and a slight drop in employment growth. August's unemployment rate for the metropolitan area was a low 2.3 percent, just a notch higher than the 2.2 percent average for the three preceding months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau's August survey of employers also shows virtually no change in job growth in the region. Employment increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the Washington area between August 1999 and this past August. The growth rate from July 1999 to this past July was 2.7 percent. The District's jobless rate moved up to 5.4 percent in August, from 5 percent in July, after allowing for seasonal employment changes. Despite the increase, the District's unemployment rate is still far lower than its average during the 1990s. Virginia's unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in August, unchanged from the month before, while Maryland's jobless number climbed to 3.5 percent in August from 3.2 percent in the previous month.
Vice President Gore today escalated his bid to put Florida in the Democratic column, telling voters here that they hold the power to decide whether prosperity will continue under a Democratic administration, or elect a Republican administration that would threaten the surplus and endanger Social Security. The choice is yours, he told about 2,000 supporters at the Walt Disney Amphitheater next to Lake Eola. This state is the key to the election, and central Florida is the key to this state, Gore declared with his running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman at his side. Gore warned the crowd that the nation's economy is on the line on Nov. 7. Prosperity itself is on the ballot all across this great state this year, he said. Prosperity itself is on the ballot in the United States of America this year. Both Gore and Lieberman claimed victory in their respective debates this week, and the vice president drew cheers and laughter as he ridiculed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's charge that Gore used fuzzy math to fault Bush tax and spending initiatives. The other side would give almost 30 percent of all their proposed tax cuts to individuals with incomes of more than 1 million per year. Those facts aren't fuzzy those facts are real, they are real. They may be inconvenient but they're not fuzzy, Gore said. To the surprise of Democratic and GOP strategists, Florida has emerged as one of the battleground states this election. The state had been moving steadily in a Republican direction and Jeb Bush, brother of George W. Bush, is the governor. President Clinton carried the state and won its 25 electoral votes in 1996, but, until late summer, few people expected Gore would have a chance to duplicate that feat.
WASHINGTON -- The unexpected decline in September's unemployment rate doesn't mean the economy has blown off its course toward a soft landing. The 0.2 percentage point decline reported by the Labor Department brought the jobless rate back down to 3.9 last month, matching a 30-year-low first reached in April. The jobless rate for African Americans fell one percentage point to a record low of 7. The numbers tell me that we haven't landed yet and that it's somewhere off in the future, but that we're still on track, said Mark Vitner, an economist with the First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Vitner, like many economists, expects third-quarter economic growth to slow to about 3.5 before speeding up to 4.1 in the final quarter. That's slightly higher than the 3 and 3.6 consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators. Still, the overall drop in the jobless rate set off alarms at the Federal Reserve, which remains worried that desperate employers will boost wages and benefits to attract or retain workers, triggering inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to slow the economy, though it has kept rates steady at its past three meetings. Many analysts said that before raising rates again this year, the central bank would have to see a similar decline in next month's jobs data, alongside a clearer indication that labor costs were rising.
The current sharp slide in the stock market has elicited a variety of explanations. We are told that investors fear a possible Gore presidency and a Democratic Congress. That Federal Reserve monetary policy has been too tight, jeopardizing the prospects for a soft landing. Or that a speculative bubble in technology stocks has finally burst. In each case it is assumed that something has changed drastically somehow, for some very important reason, investors now look at the market very differently than they did a few months ago. I believe this view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how stocks are valued. To get back to the basics, over the long run stocks are worth exactly and only an amount equal to the discounted future value of the cash flows investors expect to receive from them. This is usually taken to mean both future dividends and share repurchases that put money back into the hands of stockholders. What most analysts fail to understand when they breathlessly seek out dramatic reasons for major moves in the market is that in this model relatively minor changes in assumptions about interest rates, and the rate of future dividend increases, can create very large shifts in theoretical stock valuations. Take, for example, the 1987 crash. Immediately before the crash, dividends were roughly 3, and interest rates 10. For purposes of simplicity, we shall ignore share repurchases. This means that, given the assumptions of the model, investors before the crash were anticipating that future dividends would grow at a 7 annual rate. What if investors became slightly more conservative For example, as economist Merton Miller has pointed out, if investors in the fall of 1987 increased their forecast for interest rates by only 0.5, and also reduced the rate at which they expected dividends to grow by a similar 0.5, a whopping 25 drop in stock prices would have resulted. In fact, the market fell by 22 on Oct. 19, 1987.
WASHINGTON -- College tuition is still rising faster than inflation, increasing 4.4 at public four-year colleges and 5.2 at private four-year schools. Average tuition at public schools in the 2000-2001 academic year was 3,510, while at private schools the tab was 16,332, the College Board said in its annual report on college pricing. College Board President Gaston Caperton called the increases modest, and said inadequate academic preparation is a greater barrier to college admission than cost. But the tuition increases outpaced both the 3.5 annualized increase in the consumer price index for the first eight months of this year, and year-earlier price increases. The College Board said student aid rose 4 to 68 billion, but the aid data lag behind the college-cost survey by a year. Room-and-board costs increased by an average 5.1 to 4,960 at public colleges and by 4.2 to 6,209 at private schools. Mr. Caperton attributed the increases in both tuition and housing to students demanding more, including a lower student-teacher ratio, better housing and increased technology spending.
Internet banks have run into all kinds of problems in the U.S., but ING Group NV thinks it has some solutions. Part of its strategy biscotti and comfy sofas. Last month, the big Dutch banking and insurance concern launched its ING Direct Internet bank in the Northeastern U.S. The move was the first phase of a rollout of online banking services across the country that could take several years. In the U.S., ING will be adapting strategies that already are luring many Canadians. Starting as a telephone operation, ING Direct in Canada didn't even have Internet service until late 1998. But the online bank already has more than 300,000 clients and over three billion Canadian dollars US2 billion in deposits in the country. Like its competitors, ING attracts deposits mainly by offering easy access to accounts and beating traditional banks on interest rates. It is offering a 6.5 rate on U.S. savings accounts, for instance. But unlike many Internet banks, ING Direct targets mainly ordinary consumers rather than computer sophisticates or affluent folk with online brokerage accounts. Then it stretches to put a human face on its machine-based business. To help do this, it runs cafes that serve up generous helpings of banking information as well as espresso and biscotti. Among other functions, the cafes calm potential customers worried that their savings will somehow vanish into cyberspace. With its sofa, armchairs and popular music, the cafe on the ground floor of a Toronto office tower looks like any striving-to-be-hip coffeehouse. Giant wooden clogs and a model windmill attest to the bank's Dutch origins.
Civil service and military retirees will get a 3.5 percent increase in their retirement checks next year, the largest cost-of- living adjustment for most retirees in a decade. The Social Security Administration and Office of Personnel Management announced the benefit increase based on inflation data reported yesterday by the Labor Department. Retirees and surviving spouses covered by the Civil Service Retirement System and military annuitants will receive the 3.5 percent COLA. People who retired under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System and who are 62 or older will receive a 2.5 percent increase. The benefit increase probably will help many retirees pay for higher health insurance premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program next year. According to the latest available data, the typical CSRS retiree receives a monthly benefit of 1,811, which the COLA will increase by 63 a month. That's about double the increase in the FEHBP's popular Blue Cross and Blue Shield standard-option family plan, whose premiums are going up by 30.61 a month in 2001.
The wireless industry adopted guidelines to let customers protect their privacy and control data used by mobile phone companies to pinpoint the locations of subscribers. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association said companies will tell consumers that location information is being collected, ask them to authorize any use of the data, ensure records are secure and give consumers a chance to correct errors. The move comes as Congress prepares to tackle data privacy and carriers try to head off legislation. Worldwide personal-computer shipments rose less than expected in the third quarter and replacements of older models won't rise significantly until next year, according to a Dataquest survey. Shipments rose 15.2 percent, to 33.9 million units, from a year earlier, it said--less than the 17 percent growth predicted. It said price cuts may come as companies try to boost demand. Another researcher, IDC, reported third-quarter growth of 18 percent, to 33.3 million units, in line with its forecast. Web-based companies fired 5,677 workers in the four weeks ended Oct. 20, the largest total this year, according to a survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Since December, companies with sites offering information on finance, consulting and other industries have cut 8,113 jobs retailers, 5,450 and health and fitness companies, 2,190.
European officials tried to talk up the euro after it hit a new low against the dollar in European trading. But the jawboning -- including renewed talk of intervention from one European Central Bank official and a suggestion from a finance minister that the euro could rise 20 -- did little to spur markets to bid up the struggling common currency. In late New York trading yesterday, the euro stood at 82.94 cents, just above its record low of 82.28 cents earlier in the day. Currency-market traders said officials' silence on the euro after a Group of 20 meeting in Montreal prompted the euro's slide to the new low. The ECB will do all it can to achieve its objective of price stability, without excluding the possibility of intervention, said Eugenio Domingo Solans, an ECB executive board member, in Madrid. Mr. Domingo said the solid state of the European economy will sooner or later cause the euro to rise. The weak euro is at the root of inflation in Europe, and doesn't help the economies of the U.S. and Japan either, Mr. Domingo added. Last month the ECB, the U.S. and Japan intervened in the currency markets to prop up the euro, which initially rose but has fallen further in the past two weeks because markets doubt the U.S. would be willing to intervene again before the presidential election. In a sign of how sensitive markets are to the threat of intervention, the euro rose to its high for the day after Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, reiterated what has become the central bank's party line Intervention is a tool at the bank's disposal. Laurent Fabius, France's finance minister, stated the euro has the potential to rise 20. On the whole, Europe is in a positive position. We are not managing to get that across, Mr. Fabius said in Paris. The strong performance of the U.S. economy and perceptions of an inflexible, rigid Europe have contributed to the euro's 29 slide against the dollar since it was founded in January 1999.
The advertising slogan was supposed to trumpet the Bigfoot presence of America Online, stir consumer confidence and capture national attention. It said simply We're the biggest because we're the best. In late August, the line did get national attention, but not the kind AOL Latin America wanted. After Brazil's leading Internet provider angrily challenged AOL's claim, a national consumer regulatory group forced the company to abandon the boast. Now, AOL billboards in Brazil sport a more softly spoken pitch, referring to convenience of access This is the easy way. In its first foray into Latin America--among the world's fastest- growing Internet markets--AOL has had virtually nothing easy in Brazil. A clogged, highly complex market, a batch of unlucky breaks and what analysts call a series of strategic miscues have left the behemoth Internet service provider grasping for a place in an arena that experts predict will grow only more competitive in coming years. The struggles of AOL's Latin America venture have included not only ad campaign troubles but a highly publicized software glitch, a domain-name crisis, management turmoil and a flaccid initial public offering. Analysts say those setbacks, along with the company's failure to capitalize on its powerful brand name, have led to AOL's surprisingly soft position in a country with roughly half of Latin America's Internet users. The question now is whether AOL Latin America, a joint venture between the Dulles-based company and the Miami-based Cisneros Group, can recover from its stumbling start to forge a fresh, distinctive identity in this teeming market.
The heads of both houses of the Philippine Congress and more than 40 other legislators withdrew their support for President Joseph Estrada today, making it almost certain that he will be impeached over allegations he pocketed millions of dollars in bribes from an illegal gambling racket. The decision by Senate President Franklin Drilon, House Speaker Manuel Villar and the other legislators to resign from Estrada's ruling LAMP party and throw their support behind efforts to remove him from office has increased the pressure on Estrada to resign. The defections appear to provide opposition lawmakers with more than enough support to forward an impeachment complaint to the Senate for a potentially embarrassing trial that could result in his removal from office. We should spare the Philippine people needless suffering, said Drilon, who urged Estrada to step down. Allegations that Estrada received almost 12 million in kickbacks from tobacco taxes and an illegal numbers game have roiled the Philippines, leading to mass street protests calling for his resignation. The scandal has rocked the country's financial markets, battering the stock market and the Philippine peso. The crisis has already escalated to the point of threatening a paralysis in government and the collapse of the economy, Villar said.
They're slipped under dorm-room doors, strewed down stairwells and scattered to the winds that blow across the District's campuses. Like autumn leaves, they crackle underfoot in multicolored heaps on college lawns and sidewalks, each with its own alluring message The latest advertising technique for city bars and nightclubs has turned into a major headache for officials at some colleges. Discouraged by anti-solicitation policies banning handing out or posting fliers on college campuses, some event promoters have taken to simply dumping hundreds in one spot, then moving along quickly. They drop them in the quad as if, 'Whoops Dropped them'  said Elana Nightingale, a sophomore at American University, which has been hit hard by the scatter phenomenon. Recently, Nightingale saw someone open a high window on campus and release a stack of fliers into a stiff breeze. University officials are frustrated by the eyesore caused by the handbills as well as the potential hazard--some of the ads are on slick, glossy paper that they fear could send pedestrians sprawling. Most annoying, though, is what officials see as a subtle appeal to underage drinkers.
If last week's outcome of several anti-sprawl ballot measures is any indication, Southeast voters are more willing than ever to foot the bill for buying up land before real-estate developers can get their hands on it. Now comes the hard part Cities and counties from North Carolina's Research Triangle to South Florida must stretch public dollars far enough to please voters by curbing sprawl but not spend so much that they become too financially leveraged in the process. Rising land costs in the region are making that increasingly difficult. Some local government officials project they'll have to spend significantly more than they did in the 1990s to shield only a fraction of the acreage. Land that's most threatened by development tends to be the most expensive to buy. So acquiring even small parcels can rapidly drain a public land-buying bank account, leaving a city or county with little to show for the effort. Moreover, developers and property owners, in selling the increasingly scarce land, often attempt to inflate prices, thinking they can turn a quick profit at taxpayers' expense. Land-buying programs tend to create their own real-estate markets, says Andy Walker, former state director for the Nature Conservancy of Tennessee. With mounting frequency, he adds, cities and counties find themselves having to play hardball with land speculators who think their property is worth a lot more than it really is. In Broward County, officials are primed for tough negotiations after voters last week passed a 400 million bond package to purchase undeveloped land near the Everglades and improve existing parks. Broward County will walk away from deals if price gouging becomes an issue, vows Kristin Jacobs, a Broward commissioner.
GREENSPAN By Justin Martin Perseus, 284 pages, 28 MAESTRO By Bob Woodward
TAIPEI -- Stocks tumbled 4.9 in Taiwan on continuing worries about bad loans at local banks. Most other Asian markets were also weaker, while slumping growth and auto-maker stocks dragged down most European markets. That left the Dow Jones World Stock Index down 1.30, or 2.84, to 216.05. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 1.07, or 1.70, to 157.31. A series of uncertainties has caused the Taiwan stock market to fall more than 30 since President Chen Shui-bian was elected in March, ousting the long-ruling Kuomintang. Political battles between Mr. Chen and the opposition-controlled legislature have put a question mark over his government's ability to pass crucial legislation. Local banks are faced with rising bad loans, and the extent of the problem isn't known because banks here generally don't follow international standards in reporting such loans. With so much uncertainty rattling investors, any news can be an excuse to sell, said Roger Yang, a fund manager at ABN Amro Asset Management. Mr. Yang said concerns about rising bad loans at local banks were one of the main reasons behind the drop in share prices. Separately, the government refused to release the results of a consumer-confidence survey. The decision was reported yesterday in the Economic Daily News, but didn't immediately affect market sentiment. It was the first time since the quarterly survey began in 1998 that it has failed to come out.
Stymied by concerns about interest rates and earnings, investors pushed stock prices lower today, focusing again on technology issues. The latest blow for the high-tech sector was Merrill Lynch's downgrading of the fiber-optic industry, which had been seen as the last solid performer in the industry. And investors were still shaken by the renewed prospect of higher interest rates that would further cut into corporate earnings. Stock prices fluctuated in a narrow range for much of the day as the market sought a direction. By late afternoon, investors found a path downward. The Nasdaq composite index fell 133.61 points to close at 3031.88, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 17.49 at 1372.32, according to preliminary calculations. Both indexes have a large representation of high-tech stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 51.57 at 10,656.03. You're still seeing a lack of deep conviction on the part of the bulls, said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. So the market seems to be driven by the news of the day.
NEW YORK -- A plunge in stock prices helped lift Treasurys prices moderately. But traders said bond-market activity was muted as many people pared back trading positions well ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday in the U.S. Late yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 732 point, or 2.19 per 1,000 face value, at 100 1632. Its yield fell to 5.664 from 5.694 late Friday, as yields move inversely to prices. Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 932 at 106 2832 to yield 5.752, down from 5.773 Friday. There weren't any major economic indicators during the session, and that left the bond market to focus primarily on the weakness in stocks. The Nasdaq Composition Index plummeted 151.44 points to 2875.75, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 167.22 points to 10462.65. When stock prices fall sharply, investors often move funds to the relative safety of government securities. Some of the gains yesterday in Treasurys reflected such shifts, although a portion of the market's movement stemmed only from anticipation that investors would move to bonds from stocks.
WASHINGTON -- The trade deficit exploded to a record in September, as Americans continued to soak up imported goods and U.S. exporters were hurt by damped economic growth overseas. The gap between exports and imports hit 34.3 billion, almost 13 wider than economists had expected for the month and 15 larger than the revised 29.8 billion deficit posted in August, the Commerce Department reported. The result of weaker exports is slower overall growth in the U.S., with economists now estimating that gross domestic product rose at a 2 annualized rate in the third quarter of the year, not the 2.7 the government previously had calculated. That would be the slowest growth rate since the U.S. economy limped ahead 0.8 in the second quarter of 1995. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy grew at an estimated 5.2 rate for the year ended Sept. 30. And even the reduced third-quarter pace in the U.S. is stronger and more consistent than the growth rates of its big overseas business partners. European growth has slowed recently, while Japan's perennially sluggish economy still hasn't gotten much traction. You have U.S. growth continuing to outpace the rest of the world, said Gerald D. Cohen, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York, adding, If we grow faster than our major trading partners, we'll pull in more imports than we export.
It's not just the festive decorations or frantic shoppers that signal the start of the holiday season. There's also the rising price of butter. It just seems to happen almost every year at this time, said Marc Randolph, owner of the Arlington bakery Pastries by Randolph. In the past three weeks, Randolph has watched the price of butter climb on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange--where wholesale prices are set-- from about 1.20 a pound to 1.80, a 50 percent increase. Randolph now expects the price he's been paying his supplier to rise accordingly before the year is over We use a ton of butter a week, so this will put a little cramp in the business. Randolph said he doesn't plan to charge more for his products to recoup the cost because many customers won't be able to pay the price. But he said if prices get real bad, he may have to cut back production of some of the butter-laden holiday goods to keep his costs in line.
In your Nov. 16 Technology Journal article Outsourcing Firms Shift Gears in Tight Market, the outsourcing development may be quite positive for the industry. As you point out, the U.S. outsourcing market is changing and 1999 revenues that were inflated by Y2K and ERP spending are unlikely to reappear anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are many positive trends, including global expansion of outsourcing to offset slower growth in a more mature U.S. market, greater spending on infrastructure, applications management and network services to facilitate the transition to e-business, and an aging federal information technology staff that will accelerate federal sector outsourcing, especially to enable e-government. If the so-called outsourcing dinosaurs have been outflanked by their smaller, newer competitors, the tide may well be reversing in favor of size, broad experience and financial staying power as the scramble for qualified IT staff intensifies. At a time when corporate IT departments and governmental agencies alike are confronting a work force nearing retirement, new IT graduates favor established outsourcers and shun the civil service. This will only intensify the trend toward outsourcing. If so, stock investors would be well advised to adopt a longer-term investment horizon. Announcements of layoffs should be understood as normal repositionings by outsourcers that acquire new staff with each contract win. They don't necessarily presage revenue shortfalls, and the growth of revenues from non-U.S. market doesn't signal a souring of the U.S. market. Albert Nekimken Vice President
WASHINGTON -- With signs that the job market is softening only a bit, consumer confidence remains high heading into the holiday shopping season, giving beleaguered retailers a reason to cheer. The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed by an unexpectedly large 7,000 last week while a longer-term gauge hit its highest level in nearly two years. The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months. Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment actually increased in November, surprising analysts expecting a decline due to stock-market weakness and continuing election uncertainty. The index finished the month at 107.6, nearly two points higher than its 105.8 level in October and only a few points below the record set in January. The report offered a burst of good news for the nation's retailers, who have seen their stock prices battered in recent weeks amid evidence of slackening sales and dire predictions for a relatively weak holiday-shopping season. Most retailers' fortunes rest on the crowds of shoppers who flock to their stores between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. The new data suggest that such fears may be groundless. With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect robust growth in consumer spending, said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
This little question is the third rail of technology journalism. No other aspect of personal computing attracts so much emotion, or lands so much hate-mail in journalists' in boxes accusing them of bias. To make my own background clear I've got a Mac on my desk at home and a PC on my desk at work. I swear at both. If it means anything, I've gotten a little more hate-mail from Apple advocates than PC partisans. But apart from those true believers, there are people who would just like to know which platform will be a better fit for their own purposes. There's no right answer, but here are a few things to ponder Cost At the entry level, there's no longer a big difference between the prices of Macs and PCs. The cheapest PC-and-monitor combo with 64 megabytes of memory a realistic minimum at Best Buy's site costs 580 after a rebate. The cheapest iMac system available costs 800. That 220 isn't pocket change, but it's not a huge gap, either. Apple stays roughly competitive with its rivals throughout the iMac line. But between 1,500 and 2,000, Apple has nothing to compete with Windows machines. If you're looking for a computer with some open expansion slots and a 17-inch monitor, a desktop PC will be awfully cheap compared to a Power Mac G4. Reliability Both operating systems crash. A lot. Yes, it's possible to fine-tune either system to a remarkable degree of stability, but most users have neither the time nor the aptitude for that kind of tweaking. I'm not addressing Microsoft's more reliable, more expensive and more resource-intensive Windows 2000, which is designed for business use.
ATLANTA -- In its second major restructuring in three months, iXL Enterprises Inc. said it will cut 35 of its work force, sell several units and take an unspecified fourth-quarter charge. The Web consulting company said that by shedding 850 more employees, closing several offices and selling some business units it can focus on its biggest customers and become profitable in the first half of 2001. The company said it will concentrate on about 75 major clients -- down from 300 currently -- and target the areas of financial services, travel and retail and consumer packaged goods. Chairman and Chief Executive U. Bertram Ellis said the latest moves go much further than the 350 layoffs and management shuffle he promised would turn the company around in September. We did not cut deep enough. We cut the fat out of the system, but we did not change the company, Mr. Ellis said of the previous restructuring. This time we've changed the company. It's a very, very radical step that would be sufficient even under our worst-case scenario. Mr. Ellis said that by slashing the company's costs, iXL will be able to operate profitably on revenue from its largest customers. The company's top 75 clients currently generate 90 of the company's sales, he said. Mr. Ellis conceded that the moves will slow iXL's revenue growth, which in the past often exceeded 35 in successive quarters. He declined to predict what the company's growth rate will be in the future or to specify how big the fourth-quarter charge will be.
Jaap van der Meer was in a bit of a box. The Alpnet Inc. president needed cash to exercise 150,000 stock options this summer, but didn't want to sell any of his Alpnet shares, worried that it would send a negative signal to investors. So he borrowed against his roughly 3.2 million stake in the Salt Lake City multilingual information-services firm. As the head of a company, you're almost like a celebrity, says Mr. van der Meer. When a senior executive sells shares, he adds, it never looks very good. Neither, in hindsight, does his decision to borrow. After he took out the loan, Alpnet stock sank 40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Mr. van der Meer was forced to dump the 150,000 shares he had exercised when the stock was trading at about 2.30. He sold, or planned to sell, most of those shares at prices ranging from 73 cents to 1.31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Mr. van der Meer says the sale was triggered by a margin call, a demand that he come up with additional cash or stock. He still holds 1.2 million Alpnet shares valued at 712,500. In February, his Alpnet stake was valued at 14.2 million. At the time of the loan, we felt, our company is doing well and the stock market will reflect that,'  says Mr. van der Meer. But, he laments, markets are unpredictable and irrational.
So many job seekers are like Myra Walker, living in the city without a car. So many employers are like Frank Hearl Jr. of the Dulles Airport Marriott, based in a suburb where nearly everybody already has a job. A job fair yesterday in the Reeves Center, at 14th and U streets NW, brought together people like Walker and Hearl in an attempt to solve a problem faced by the region for decades Most new jobs are in the suburbs, while most of the unemployed are in the city. More than 650 applicants from the city, where unemployment is 6 percent, showed up for about 500 jobs in the Dulles corridor, where unemployment is less than 1.5 percent. Putting city job seekers in touch with suburban recruiters was only part of the plan, since even when District residents know of work outside the Capital Beltway, many have no way of getting there. So the job fair was timed to coincide with Monday's start of a Metro bus route between L'Enfant Plaza and Dulles International Airport. The buses are to run hourly from 530 a.m. to 1130 p.m., seven days a week, with fares of 1.10 each way. I just felt like it was a blessing, said Walker, 38, who lives in Petworth and was looking for a customer service position. If the jobs are in Virginia, it's a good thing they come here to recruit.
The U.S. economy grew at just a 2.4 percent annual rate in the July-September period, the slowest pace in four years, according to revised figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department. An unusual decline in federal government purchases of goods and services and smaller gains in business spending on new equipment and inventories were the primary reasons for the substantial drop from the second quarter's 5.6 percent growth rate. Commerce last month initially estimated third-quarter growth at a 2.7 percent rate, but more complete data recently available caused the downward revision. As they had when the original figures were released, however, a number of analysts said the nation's economic situation remains solid with growth likely to pick up again to between a 3 percent and 4 percent rate in the final three months of the year and continue in that range for some time. The headline was a lot weaker than underlying demand, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. Private domestic demand grew at a 4.4 percent rate in the third quarter, far from indicating any serious problems in the broad economy. We expect growth to rise north of 3 percent in the fourth quarter and in 2001.
When the nation's bankruptcy rate started to drop last year, John Garza felt the impact almost immediately. Business at his suburban Maryland bankruptcy law firm slowed so much that he was forced to let half of his 15 attorneys go, and several of the survivors quit in frustration over their reduced earnings. Mr. Garza, for his part, had time for other pursuits. I played a ton a golf, he remembers. These days, tee times are down and court time is up. The caseload of Mr. Garza's firm rose more than 15 last month alone, leading him to hire a new attorney. We're like vultures perched on the telephone pole, waiting for the disaster so that we can eat, he says of his firm, which handles both personal and business bankruptcies. Well, the vultures are about to spread their wings. With interest rates up and the economy slowing, many households are discovering that their bills for years of torrid spending are coming due just as they are ill prepared to pay them. As a result, growing numbers of Americans are seeking court protection from their creditors. Personal bankruptcies, as measured by a 12-week moving average of filings, have increased nearly 10 since January. The moving average hit 24,288 for the week ending Nov. 4, up from 22,291 in the week ending Jan. 1, according to data from Visa. Extended over an entire year, that pace would translate into about 1.26 million personal bankruptcy filings, a notch lower than the 1.28 million filings recorded last year. Indeed, after rising steadily for most of the past decade, personal bankruptcies fell in 1999 amid low interest rates and solid wage gains associated with the nation's ultratight labor market. But what concerns many analysts is that the pace of bankruptcies appears to be accelerating. SMR Research Corp., a consumer-debt research firm in Hackettstown, N.J., estimates that bankruptcy filings will rise as much as 15 next year, easily surpassing 1998's record 1.4 million filings.
LONDON -- No matter where you look in Europe, telecommunications companies are struggling to raise money. Investors have all but turned their backs on the sector, and the Dow Jones Stoxx telecommunications index has plunged 32 this year. The latest victim is Telenor of Norway, which was forced to slash the price range on the final day of order-taking for its high-profile initial public offering. European telecommunications and technology shares bounced back Friday, though most major markets closed only moderately higher. Asian stocks rallied, showing little effect from the sharp fall in Nasdaq overnight. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.92, or 1.91, to 208.68. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 1.5, or 2.29, to 155.28. Young European telecommunications companies have been shut out of the high-yield bond market for months, and yields in Goldman Sachs' sub-investment-grade Euro Telecom bond index have doubled from their lows of the year to 20.26 on Thursday. Only blue-chip stalwarts can still raise cash using their investment-grade ranking, though even they must offer higher yields to attract buyers. British Telecommunications, for example, had to increase the yield for its 6 billion to 8 billion global bond offering, which is expected to be priced today. Now, the loan market is starting to freeze up, according to some bankers. Syndicated loans typically have been the most stable source of funding for companies, and telecommunications concerns have borrowed a record 216.4 billion this year, according to Capital DATA Bondware.
WASHINGTON -- As international financial troubleshooters cobble together multibillion-dollar rescue packages for Turkey and Argentina, they're haunted by memories of how isolated economic woes in a few countries in the late 1990s grew into a global financial crisis. This time, the International Monetary Fund and the Clinton administration hope to contain the upheaval with a 7.5 billion loan for Turkey and new financing -- still being negotiated -- for Argentina. But they're still anxious that investors, already fretting about a possible U.S. recession and skittish about emerging markets, might react to trouble in the two countries by withdrawing their money from other developing nations. What the fund is worried about is they want to localize this stuff because there are other problems out there, said Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a think tank here. Those other problems -- a slowing U.S. economy, high oil prices, stock-market volatility and political turmoil in nations ranging from Peru to Indonesia -- are serious enough without a major developing nation finding itself unable to pay foreign debts, Mr. Goldstein said. IMF and U.S. officials say they don't believe the problems have spread yet, although even if they did believe it they would be reluctant to say so aloud for fear of sparking panic. Investors, they say, learned from the Asian crisis not to shun one country just because a neighbor overspends its budget or allows its banks to make unwise loans. Obviously, markets are nervous, said an IMF official. But they also recognize and seem to reward countries that are following good policies or getting their acts together.
Not with a bang but with a whimper. That's how the Clinton-Gore economy stumbles to an end. It's not a pretty sight. But will we end up mired in recession Don't bet on it. We should skirt a recession and resume our prosperous march, as long as Congress supports, rather than undermines, President-elect George W. Bush. As we enter the Christmas retail season, it's easy to come up with a list of sad data as long as Santa's happy list of holiday gifts. Durable goods orders dropped 5.5 in October and, of course, the Nasdaq Stock Market has lost 32 in 2000. The economic bears are on a rampage, forcing the bulls to hibernate for the winter. How did we get here Wasn't it just yesterday that gross domestic product growth was galloping at a 5 pace and financial authors sparked a bidding war over Dow 36,000, Dow 40,000 or Dow 100,000 Who broke up the party and launched this battle against our prosperity Let's use the acronym FOE, pointing our indignant finger at the Federal Reserve Board, OPEC and the euro. Each of these institutions has knocked us a few degrees off course. Of the three, at least the Federal Reserve had good intentions. Back on May 16, the day the Fed pushed up short-term rates by 50 basis points, I suggested on this page that the economy was preparing to slow on its own, and that bond bears worried too much about inflation. If only my bet on the New York Mets came out so lucky. Be careful what you wish for. . . goes the old saw. So now the Fed has achieved the slowdown it tried to engineer. Fewer cars are rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit, and carpenters will hammer fewer nails into new homes this winter. The junk-bond market has slammed its doors, and the Fed reports that bank loan officers have choked lending standards tighter today than during the 1998 credit crunch. On Tuesday, Alan Greenspan prudently and presciently softened his inflation warnings, pointing out that a flabby stock market could signal or precipitate a softening in spending. For now, at least, we don't have to fret about irrational exuberance in share prices.
Weaker earnings. Slowing growth. Rising defaults. A surge in bad loans. Not the ideal environment for making money in the stock market -- and certainly not in banking shares. So as bank after bank announces bitter earnings surprises because of dud loans -- the latest being Bank of America this week -- how are investors making money In short, the strategy is to avoid the megabanks focused on corporate lending and buy banks focused on the consumer. This has yielded solid returns as smaller community lenders have soared. The closer you are to the consumer right now, the better, said David Ellison, manager at bank-fund FBR Fund Advisors, a small Boston money-management firm that has posted returns above 20 far this year. Mr. Ellison, for one, pared back his holdings in big regional banks such as Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial, long considered leaders of the banking industry. At the same time, he invested in lowly thrifts, unsung mortgage specialists like Golden West Financial and Astoria Financial, both of which have risen despite the current economic environment.
Retailers call the period between Dec. 1 and the last weekend before Christmas the Dead Zone. Sales typically slow between the Thanksgiving-weekend crush and the right-before-Christmas panic, and shoppers procrastinate endlessly. But this year, the Dead Zone is more lifeless than ever. Traffic at department stores slid close to 5 last week from a year ago, and mall sales fell 6.9, despite a hefty bout of promotional sales. Worried about keeping Internet shoppers engaged and spending, online retailer Amazon.com Inc. extended its free November shipping offer on orders over 100 into December, a move designed to lure customers into purchasing before the last minute. Even giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales were running below plan for the week after Thanksgiving at both its namesake discount stores and its Sam's Clubs division. With the stock market shaky and mounting signs of an economic slowdown, the midseason lull is making retailers particularly edgy this year. Despite a selling sweep on a handful of unexpectedly popular toys, most economists are predicting that holiday sales will be lukewarm, at best, this Christmas. And one big fear is lurking in many retailers' minds that a last minute snowstorm will keep some shoppers from resuming their shopping spree on Dec. 23. Such jitters are exacerbated by the fact that Christmas this year falls on a Monday, giving procrastinators the luxury of an entire weekend to whisk down Main Street or pop over to the mall and scoop up items, many on sale, at the last minute. Except for the odd, annoying relative who finishes holiday shopping in October, most Americans tend to put it off to the very last minute Over the last decade, the busiest shopping day of the year has shifted from the day after Thanksgiving to the Saturday before Christmas. Hopes of a late rush are of little comfort to retailers whose stores right now are full of merchandise but short on holiday shoppers. It is looking very painful, and it feels painful to look at the numbers now, if you don't realize what the calendar is doing, says Beryl Raff, chief executive of Zale Corp., who adds that she expects a surge of traffic the weekend before Christmas. The reality is that this is a Christmas that can't be read until December 25.
With U.S. economic growth slowing, the nation's unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent last month while employers' payrolls grew only modestly, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Analysts said the report provided further confirmation that growth has slowed recently from the very rapid pace of the first half of this year, which many economists and policymakers regarded as unsustainable. However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump. While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent. It looks pretty favorable to me, said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply. If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect. Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning, Glassman said. Everybody has gotten gloomy about the outlook because of companies warning about profits and the stock market is down. In financial markets, there is stress and worry about credit problems. But to me this is all part of the process of cooling off from a superheated growth rate.
With the exquisite timing of a master politician, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week thrust himself into the middle of what has become a raging debate over the near-term prospects for the U.S. economy. Will the U.S. economy be able to manage a soft landing from the heights of spectacular and speculative growth of the past two years, as Greenspan had hoped when he initiated a series of interest-rate increases last year Or has the economy now slowed so far so fast in the past few months that a recessionary hard landing is as likely as not Back in 1996, Greenspan had warned Wall Street of an irrational exuberance that, if not contained, could eventually derail the American economy. His plea for moderation, while widely noted, was also widely ignored, and the Fed was forced to step in last year and raise interest rates in an effort to slow U.S economic growth to a less threatening pace. Now, four years later to the day, Greenspan was in New York before a group of bankers pleading for moderation once again. This time his concern was about an irrational foreboding that seems to have gripped Wall Street, which Greenspan warned could be a self-fulfilling prophecy if investors refuse to invest and lenders refuse to lend. Signaling an imminent change in Fed policy later this month, he hinted that the Fed was ready to cut interest rates at the first credible signs that the economy was headed for a crash landing. Although Greenspan's calming words triggered a brief rally in the financial markets, they were quickly drowned out by another wave of gloomy news coming out of corporate America--bad-loan problems at the country's biggest bank, declining sales of personal computers and computer chips, and holiday shutdowns of many of the nation's auto plants. And just Friday, the index of consumer confidence recorded its largest monthly drop in a decade.
Last summer, as the NASDAQ temporarily staggered back from its spring drubbing, a still brash Internet company ran a full-page newspaper ad with a bold and memorable line Thanks, old economy, we'll take it from here. The ad got it exactly wrong. With the technology-heavy NASDAQ stock exchange about 40 percent below its March highs, the new economy no longer seems limitless. The American economy is entering an economic downturn. But even as the new economy implodes, the old economy will sustain us. This is a good thing It means that the slowdown will be short and shallow after an impossibly long economic boom. There will be other ironies in the coming months, the juiciest of which will be that old economy firms will surf the downturn more easily precisely because they have aggressively adopted high technology and made effective use of the massive structural shifts unleashed by New Economy forces. Make no mistake, the downturn will feel awful. Going from 6 percent growth to 2 percent growth is a terrible swoon. But it will not be awful. Despite a truckload of Chicken Littles predicting the end of the economic world, current economic indicators are pointing to a mild slump that never becomes a classic recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
Cysive Inc., a Reston Internet consulting firm, yesterday announced its plan to lay off workers for the first time in its seven- year history and lowered projections for its revenue and earnings in the quarter that ends Dec. 31. The company expects to cut 40 to 50 non-engineers, or 13 percent to 16 percent of its staff. Cysive also will freeze additional hiring, company officials said. The layoffs are part of a broader restructuring effort that will cost Cysive up to 8 million before taxes. Between 1 million and 2 million will go toward severance pay, the rest toward bad debt and real estate restructuring. Cysive, which customizes software systems, is reeling from cancellations, delays and spending freezes among some of its customers. In August the company dropped its largest customer in a payment dispute and said it would forgo nearly 4 million in revenue in the third quarter and another 1.5 million this quarter. At least one Cysive client could possibly file for bankruptcy protection, Cysive officials said yesterday in response to questioning from analysts. As a result, the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue expectations to 9 million from 14 million. It dropped its projections for net income to a loss of 10 to 12 cents per share, before the restructuring charges, compared with the loss of 2 to 3 cents per share expected only a few weeks earlier.
Frustrated by a decade of insane prices for everything from art to real estate, many Americans see a silver lining to the wobbly economy -- the chance to finally swoop in on some deals. Eileen Daspin and June Fletcher report. With the economy slowing and prices softening, Washington Redskins fan Paul Sawyer has one wish that things will get just a little bit worse. It's the only way Mr. Sawyer figures he'll ever move up the 45,000-name waiting list for Redskins' season tickets. The more the stock market wobbles, the harder he scours the classifieds for down-on-their-luck ticket holders. Not to mention other bargains he's eyeing if the economy keeps stumbling. I hate to prey on anyone's misfortune, says Mr. Sawyer, who has been reduced to watching games on television. But I won't feel too awful if someone loses their luxury. After a decade of watching prices go insane for everything from art to real estate, a lot of Americans see an upside to the economic downturn a chance to finally swoop in on some relative deals. The result is a kind of vulture culture, as Americans at almost every income level see some potential relief in every hiccup of the stock market. The hopes are especially high for bargains on big-ticket items that saw frenzied demand as the New Economy soared homes, waitlisted cars, high-end electronics and spa vacations -- the very things that often suffer first in a slump.
Corrections & Amplifications FIDELITY INVESTMENTS' Contrafund estimates it will declare a capital-gains distribution equal to 9 of the portfolio's net-asset value on Dec. 29. Friday's Fund Track included Contrafund in a group of funds expected to have a distribution in the 20 range. WSJ Dec. 18, 2000 Ouch It is bad enough that lots of stock funds have negative returns this year. But many of those money-losing funds are about to sock shareholders with a big tax bill, too. Expect the worst of this one-two punch to hit investors in the coming two weeks. That is when perhaps as many as half of all funds finally make the capital-gains distributions required by the end of the calendar year, just as shareholders will see what year-end investment returns from their fund holdings will be.
LONDON -- If Dr. Frankenstein were a money manager or foreign-exchange trader, would the euro be his currency of choice A month ago, Steve Barrow, a currency strategist at Bear, Stearns & Co. in London, vigorously argued yes. Europe seems to have created the currency equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, and it is running amok, he wrote to clients, noting forecasts that the euro would become a big currency in terms of trade, bond issuance, investment and as a reserve asset held by central banks. Europe's common currency, he predicted, would fall toward 75 U.S. cents next year. Now Mr. Barrow, whose euro predictions have been better than most, is singing a different tune -- and that's without a visit from Mary Shelley, the monster's creator. The 38-year-old native of East London now says he sees the euro at 95 cents in six months and 1.05 in 12. Mr. Barrow has lots of company. Confronted with the euro's 5.7 surge in the past three weeks, untold numbers of traders, analysts, portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and just plain old investors are trying to figure out whether they are experiencing future shock, which American author Alvin Toffler, 35 years ago, defined as the dizzying disorientation brought on by the premature arrival of the future.
IRRATIONAL exuberance Make that uncontrollable, indefatigable, unreasonable, outlandish exuberance. Before the market's great fall early this year, investors managed to convince themselves that this time was different, that stocks couldn't go down very much, or for very long if they did. Bolstered by this ill-advised overconfidence, lots of people did lots of things they no doubt wish they hadn't. Turn back the clock, to the first quarter of this year. Investors who were content to settle for mutual funds and stocks with 10 to 20 annual returns were made to feel like, well, dullards. They just didn't get it. The people who did get it were leaving their Old Economy jobs for the excitement and riches of dot-com-dom. Or, if they didn't go to work for Internet companies, they were working with Internet companies and getting a piece of the action by taking shares in lieu of cash for business they did. Now, much of that stock may be more valuable as wallpaper.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve promised to throw a life preserver to the U.S., declaring that the risks of economic weakness in the foreseeable future exceed the risks of inflation. But it left short-term interest rates unchanged. Financial markets now expect the Fed to begin cutting rates at the end of January, and to reduce them at least one-half percentage point by spring. Abandoning its 19-month stance that it was primarily worried about inflation pressures, Fed officials ended their meeting with a statement saying, The drag on demand and profits from rising energy costs, as well as eroding consumer confidence, reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings, and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economic growth may be slowing further. Although some inflation risks persist, the Fed added, they are diminished by the more-moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased. In contrast to recent Fed statements, this one included no mention of the inflationary dangers of tight labor markets. Until a report in The Wall Street Journal this week, financial markets had expected the Fed to declare the risks of inflation and recession about equal. Even though the Fed went further than that, financial markets initially were disappointed that rates weren't cut. Stocks, which had been up before the Fed's announcement in the hopes of a rate cut, sank soon thereafter. As investors' concerns about corporate profits grow, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 61.05 to 10584.37, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 112.81 to 2511.71, a painful 4.3 drop.
NEW YORK -- Treasury prices ended lower after Federal Reserve policy makers did what many bond investors had anticipated. The Fed left its target for the federal-funds, or overnight bank, lending rate, unchanged at 6.50. But its announcement of the decision suggested that the Fed is leaning toward lowering interest rates in the near future. It said that although there remains some potential for inflation, the risks to the economy now are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. Largely because of optimism about interest rates, Treasurys had managed four consecutive higher closes through Friday, and most issues ended higher again Monday. Yesterday, prices trended lower on profit-taking earlier in the day, then recovered some on the news of the Fed decision. But, the market was basically expecting this, and had something like this priced in, said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. announced yesterday that he will step down by mid-February, ending the longest chairmanship in the agency's history. Levitt, 69, has overseen the nation's securities markets during a period of remarkable change since President Clinton appointed him in 1993. He told reporters that he had met with vice president-elect Dick Cheney at transition headquarters in McLean to tell him of his plans and that an acting chairman might be named before the new administration selects his replacement. Levitt could have remained a member of the commission until June 2003. He said he has not decided what he will do next. Observers and members of the securities world yesterday described Levitt much as he describes himself as an advocate for the investor.
President Clinton issued an order in late November setting the January 2001 federal raise at 3.7 percent, on average. But saying that white-collar federal employees will receive an average raise of a certain amount tells only part of the story, and numerous employees have asked for a primer on pay. A There are two components to General Schedule raises--the across- the-board part and the portion divided up as locality pay. For 2001, 2.7 percentage points of the raise will go to the former and 1 percentage point to the latter. The government divides the funds available for locality pay among 32 designated localities based on how they rank in terms of pay gaps with local private-sector salaries. The calculation produced a 3.81 percent raise for the Washington-Baltimore locality for 2001. Although many Washington area employees believe the region gets or should get one of the biggest portions of the annual locality payout, it actually ranks in the middle of the pack among localities. Employees in the San Francisco area get the most. For example, the annual salary this year for a GS-15, step 1, is 89,264 in San Francisco, compared with 84,638 in Washington and 82,876 in the lowest-paid locality designation, the catchall rest of the United States, for employees outside the selected metropolitan areas. The distribution of locality pay is based on local wage markets, not on local living costs. There has been substantial controversy over the years about the methods used to calculate pay gaps and about whether a pay gap with the private sector even exists.
ROME -- How felicitous it sounds in Italian globalizzazione. And why not For much of history, this was globalization. The outlines remain visible still, in the marble of Bernini and Michelangelo, in the Latin ringing the nave of St. Peter's, in the broken imperial columns that have not held a roof for 2,000 years. Respectively they evoke what was once the world order a common faith, a common language, a common law. The pilgrims who have filled the Eternal City this jubilee year remind us that it is also an order whose better angels retain a power to inspire. Clearly Pope John Paul II believes so. For when he looks out at the Third Millennium that begins this Christmas, he sees opportunity the chance to restore man to his proper footing, in solidarity with his neighbor and obedience to the truth. Understandably this has been read as at best an exercise in sentimentality or at worst a call for some Roman restoration. In fact, this civilization of solidarity emanates from the human heart out rather than some central authority down. And a recent Vatican conference suggests that a truly free and truly global economy may be one of its crucial ingredients. Granted, there are significant differences between love of neighbor and business, says the Rev. Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute. But perhaps not as many as one might imagine at first.
Americans quickly come to think of pleasures as entitlements, so as the gaudy economic expansion encounters turbulence, they seem not just stunned but affronted. The stock market, however, is simply doing its job, reallocating capital from unproductive to more productive uses. This is, so far, what a soft landing of a high- flying economy looks like. And the vocal angst of many investors is what a soft landing sounds like in a spoiled nation that is becoming the crybaby of the Western world. Economic expansions are not like human beings and light bulbs. Expansions do not inevitably expire of natural causes. They could continue indefinitely, absent policy blunders by government or major mistakes by sizable elements of the private sector. The latter sort of mistakes have been made, particularly in overinvestment in technology and dot-com sectors. But government has two powerful levers for moving the faltering economy--interest rates, which are high, and fiscal policy, which is tight because government is running a surplus. Interest rates and taxes can be lowered. Anyway, America's long expansion may not be over. Housing starts are up, the job market remains strong, and some producers' difficulties are consumers' delights AT&T has cut its dividend for the first time in 113 years, and its stock is down 60 percent, but, then, long distance rates have fallen 35 percent in seven years, and cell phone rates even faster--in effect, a huge transfer of wealth from producers to consumers of those services. Third-quarter growth 2.4 percent was less than half the second- quarter rate 5.6, and sobering economic indicators have been multiplying for many months. Sobriety--a virtue, lest we forget--was producing dot-com carnage last spring. Investors were at long last pulling back from valuing companies for prospects--often chimerical-- rather than profits, and were belatedly acknowledging that, ultimately, profits dictate share prices. On Oct. 12, in a sell-off unrelated to technology, the Dow began falling 379.21 points 3.6 percent minutes after Home Depot, one of Wall Street's top growth stocks and a bellwether of consumer spending, warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' expectations. Home Depot's stock plunged 28 percent because the firm's growth was 4 rather than 7 percent. But 4 percent is hardly agony. Besides, the analysts who set expectations sell stocks- -so they sell expectations. Furthermore, Home Depot ascribed its disappointment to the happy fact, for consumers, of falling prices of some building products. For example, during the summer, when housing starts slowed, sawmills did not, so lumber prices fell.

Do you own a computer Juan Velez continues, telling the woman about the digital divide, the gap between the people who do and don't have access to the Internet. Many of the jobs in the next century will require computer skills, he says.

Five other teenage volunteers are nearby, giving the same windup to other downtown visitors on a recent Saturday. They are part of an unorthodox technology-promotion campaign that began three months ago in this working-class town dotted with abandoned textile and paper mills. The organization they represent is no charity. It's part of a growing group of for-profit enterprises trying to do well by doing good. The business models of such start-ups make some uncomfortable, and it's unclear how many will survive the current high-tech shakeout. But proponents say the companies show promise in serving markets long ignored by mainstream businesses. Digital Mafia Entertainment Inc.

WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown. The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop. The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth. Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one. That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as somewhat disconcerting.
I am responding to the Dec. 21 Letter to the Editor from Anuradha Mittal and Peter Rosset commenting on Norman Borlaug's Dec. 6 editorial-page essay We Need Biotech to Feed the World It is disingenuous on the part of critics of biotechnology to keep saying that there is enough food in the world and thus argue against scientific advances such as biotechnology to improve food production. Sure, there are plenty of food grains in the world, but most of them are in the West and much of them fed to animals 70 of corn produced in the U.S. is fed to livestock. Perhaps we can solve all the hunger in the world by asking everyone to become vegetarians in the West and then just ask Iowa farmers to donate their grains to the developing world. Export of food from developing countries accounts for only a small percentage of the global food trade, and much of it is in high-value tropical commodities that provide badly needed foreign-exchange for these countries. How does one improve access and distribution of food to the rural poor dependent on farming By improving farm productivity and by enhancing the infrastructure and policies that promote free trade. In South Asia and Africa, where much of the poor in the world live, the large majority of the people are involved in farming. Technologies such as genetically modified crops will help these people not only to produce more food, but also to increase their income. Increased prosperity of the rural sector would clearly help in reducing hunger and in narrowing the inequity between urban and rural people. It is the local production of food and greater income from farm products that can help the rural poor, and biotechnology will help them to reduce the chemical inputs on the farm, reduce labor and fuel, cut down farming costs, produce more nutritious food and improve the overall productivity. Can Messrs. Mittal and Rosset offer any alternative sustainable solutions to global hunger and poverty, or solutions for improving access and distribution of food other than distributing the surplus among those who desperately need it India is also home to me, as it is to Mr. Mittal India has increased food-grain production fourfold since independence in 1947, and a higher percentage of Indians are better fed today than ever before thanks to the Green Revolution. And this has happened while the population has also increased threefold due to medical advances.
NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut could help step up the pace of mergers and acquisitions in early 2001. The momentum that generated eight straight record years for M&A expansion began to falter in the second half of 2000 because of stock-market gyrations and a correction in valuations that damaged the purchasing power of potential acquirers. Jitters about the economy and market volatility prompted investment bankers and M&A lawyers to predict a sluggish start to 2001. But with the Fed's rate cut, announced earlier than expected, some of those concerns could be alleviated. To the extent that CEOs and decision makers become more positive about the economy, it's going to lead to decisions being made sooner rather than later, said Rick Escherich, a managing director in J.P. Morgan's M&A group. There's still a tremendous amount of activity going on under the surface, but there's been reluctance to pull the trigger on deals. The degree to which CEO confidence is restored, however, still hinges on how successful the Fed's move is in bringing in a soft landing for the economy. At this stage, it is too soon to gauge that impact, according to bankers. It's obviously a step in the right direction, but we need to see a continued improvement in the rate environment coupled with a tightening in credit spreads to see a significant impact in M&A activity, said Rick Leaman, head of mergers and acquisitions at UBS Warburg.
WASHINGTON -- President-elect George W. Bush is under growing pressure to pack his overall tax-cut plan with more breaks for business -- an area he gave scant attention during the campaign. Business lobbyists have flooded the Bush transition team with requests for everything from technical tweaks to global overhauls. And if Mr. Bush rejects adding more business cuts to his 1.6 trillion, 10-year plan, members of Congress are expressing interest in doing it themselves -- likely at the expense of Mr. Bush's big across-the-board rate reduction. Most people are of the opinion that a smaller cut that's more targeted would be better, said Sen. John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is an influential member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. I think the long-term across-the-board reduction is fine but it's expensive. Mr. Breaux cited two business-oriented breaks he favored that he believed Mr. Bush would like incentives for energy production and credits for health care. While health-care credits would benefit families directly, they also would help insurance companies sign up more customers. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week he favored more targeted provisions, including energy breaks and retirement-account reforms. Mr. Grassley said he doesn't sense sufficient support yet for Mr. Bush's across-the-board rate cut, which would provide the biggest sums to the well-to-do, but he added that he plans to keep plugging to win votes for individual rate relief, regardless.
WASHINGTON -- For the first time in years, the dreaded word recession is back as a buzzword. Oddly, though, it will be months -- or even years -- before economists know for sure if the U.S. has entered one, partly because the definition is fluid. The most common definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. This was the explanation President Clinton used to defend his legacy when reporters asked whether President-elect George W. Bush was inheriting a Clinton recession. But that definition isn't widely embraced by economists. Economic growth is sort of more on a continuum, there's nothing special about zero, says Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw. His introductory economics textbook, Principles of Economics, defines a recession more generally as a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment. In some cases, he says, two quarters may be too much. If you had a big enough fall in one quarter, you'd probably call that a recession, too, he says. For professional economists, the ultimate arbiter of economic peaks and troughs is the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee. Basically, a recession is whatever they want to call a recession, says Mr. Mankiw. The NBER is a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank devoted to promoting the understanding of how the economy works. Founded in 1920 and based in Cambridge, Mass., the NBER has been dating expansions and recessions for decades. At their Web site www.nber.org, readers can examine the ebb and flow of U.S. economic growth back to 1854.
After stumbling badly in last year's treacherous stock market, many folks are betting they'll recoup their losses during 2001. That, unfortunately, could turn out to be investors' next mistake. The critical issue In the stock market, do good years follow bad Or are returns pretty much random, and thus one year's performance doesn't tell us anything about the next 12 months If you are looking for a quick snapback, history isn't very reassuring. True, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index bounced back smartly from its most recent two annual losses, those in 1981 and 1990. But after the declines of 1969 and 1977, we had years with modest single-digit gains. And, of course, 1973's drubbing was merely a warm-up to 1974's thrashing. One bad year does not foretell a good year, says William Reichenstein, an investments professor at Baylor University. He says there is some evidence of mean reversion, suggesting results will drift back toward the average as good stretches follow bad, but it's not overwhelming.
International Business Machines Corp. reported fourth-quarter earnings rose 28, topping analysts' forecasts in a standout performance that ran counter to gloomy warnings from other companies that sell large-scale computer systems. Revenue grew 6, matching or bettering many forecasts. IBM was among the rare few big computer makers and technology companies that hadn't issued an earnings warning about results for the December quarter. And, it didn't back away from this year's numbers, either. John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney said IBM is somewhat insulated from economic turns, because about 40 of their revenues are in backlog from long-term software and service contracts. But he said he was surprised by the hardware growth. John R. Joyce, chief financial officer said the U.S. market is volatile but based on everything we know, we remain comfortable with consensus estimates for 2001. Analysts forecast 2001 earnings per share of 4.99, up 12 according to First Call.

WASHINGTON -- Wage and benefit costs remained contained in the last quarter, good news for inflation watchers. Meanwhile, a jump in unemployment claims in California could portend weakness in the country's largest state. The employment-cost index for the fourth quarter of 2000 rose 0.8 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said. That was down from a 0.9 increase in the third quarter and below consensus expectations of a 1.1 rise. It marked the third-straight deceleration in the ECI, a broad survey of labor costs that measures wages and benefits, since it jumped 1.4 in the first quarter of 2000. Overall, Americans' wages and benefits grew by 4.1 for the year, the biggest increase since a 4.3 rise in 1991. Inflation rose more slowly, meaning workers saw real gains in compensation relative to the cost of living. As long as employment costs remain low enough to keep inflation pressures down, say many economists, the message to Federal Reserve policy makers is clear. Despite the tight labor market, I think the Fed has a lot of flexibility in their deliberations on how to cut rates, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
The U.S. housing market, which helped buoy a sagging economy earlier this winter, took it on the chin in December as home sales tumbled. Sales of existing homes fell 7.4 in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.87 million units, 5.3 below the 5.14-million-unit pace in December 1999. Most economists had expected sales in the range of five million to 5.1 million units. For the full year, home sales totaled 5.03 million units in 2000. That was down 3.2 from 1999, which was a record year for home sales. Economists found the December data troubling, especially when taken with other reports suggesting the market slowed down at year's end. The Commerce Department said last week that while housing starts were up slightly in December, permit applications fell 6.6. Also, the most recent monthly survey by the National Association of Home Builders found builders are less optimistic about the market than before. While all that doesn't add up to a major slowdown, the latest sales data suggest there is a yellow flag for housing, says David Lereah, the realtors' chief economist. Not a red flag yet, but a yellow flag. He says the numbers should help assure that the Federal Reserve will lower rates by at least one-quarter of a percentage point when it meets early next week. Many economists, however, cautioned against placing too much stock in the December data. For one thing, weather was extremely bad, and even though the data are adjusted for that, the formulas used rely heavily on data from recent years when weather was unseasonably warm.
Given that the economy seems to be slowing, the policy heads are furrowing their brows over which would be better -- lower tax rates or lower interest rates. Well, it turns out that both would be best, though neither is likely to run the economy on a dime. -- Taxes. Will lower marginal tax rates spur growth Sure. Low taxes are associated with rapid growth the world around. The Reagan tax cuts, once fully implemented in 1983, ended malaise and started a boom that persisted through 2000, except for a nine-month dip in 1990 and tepid growth as the economy digested the 1990 and 1993 tax increases. We would not now be experiencing growth close to zero, as Alan Greenspan described it in his testimony last week, if we had passed a tax cut last year, when opponents warned that it would overheat the economy, whatever that may mean. And there, in timing, is precisely the rub in using tax changes as countercyclical policy. Given the political delay in crafting tax legislation, tax cuts will arrive at the right time only through blind luck. What's more, taxpayers watching the political tides anticipate tax changes, often in perverse ways. Recall, for example, what happened with the investment tax credit. Expected passage of the credit brought business investment to a halt while the players waited for it to go into effect, just as an anticipated suspension called forth a burst of activity before the suspension was enacted. Both reactions merely aggravated the economic situation the tax credits were meant to remedy. It's better to think of tax policy in structural terms, designing it to produce incentives for growth in the long run. In these terms, cutting marginal tax rates is a no-brainer for one reason -- taxes are way too high. Not only did Mr. Clinton's tax increase create de jure brackets of 15-28-31-36-39.6, but the disallowance of certain deductions and his phase-outs of exemptions make the de facto brackets even higher. In high-tax states like New York and browned-out California, the top combined federal-local marginal rate approaches 50, a level loaded with disincentives and distortions. These higher marginal rates are especially punishing because real bracket creep -- what happens as wages and salaries increase with economic and productivity growth -- pushes more people into higher brackets. As a result federal tax revenue as a percentage of the economy is remarkably fat, at levels last seen in World War II. And the evidence that taxes are way too high is hanging out there for all to see in the form of budget surpluses.
The dead have risen on Wall Street, and that has spooked some investors. The first month of the year has seen a stunning snapback in nearly every type of risky investment, the very stocks and bonds that investors thought they had slain last year. Now investors are torn Is this just a hugely exaggerated January Effect, a tax-related new-year rise in stocks that will disappear as the calendar turns, or are small technology stocks, junk bonds and emerging-markets securities going to keep rolling through the year No matter which camp they fall in, many money managers are terrified of being left behind. You can feel that panic to get invested and not miss out on a market that's taken off so strongly, says Kathleen Gaffney, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles who focuses on medium-quality and high-yield, or junk, bonds. There is a lot to be afraid of. While the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index is up 2.6 this year, the Nasdaq Composite Index already has posted a double-digit increase, having jumped 12.6. The Nasdaq's run looks pretty lame compared with really risky plays, such as the Dow Jones Internet Commerce index, which has soared 34.3.
Alan Greenspan has endorsed tax cuts and the new Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, is on board as well after having waffled a bit in his confirmation testimony. Mr. O'Neill had argued that lower interest rates, not taxes, were the first line of defense against a slowing economy. He will be pleased if the Fed gratifies widespread expectations and trims its short-term rate target again this week. He also now says he will carry the tax-cut banner with pride. With Bill Clinton out of the way, some congressional Democrats have become tax-cutters as well. The administration of George W. Bush is only in its second week, but all the political harmony in Washington is so unnatural as to be disconcerting. Even the New York Times has overcome its reluctance to admit that Bush is a legitimate president and was marveling Sunday on what a smooth transition the Bushites were conducting. No doubt things would have been even smoother for transition manager Dick Cheney if Al Gore's staffers hadn't trashed the vice presidential offices Mr. Cheney was preparing to occupy. But kids will be kids. The honeymoon won't last, of course. The docility of the Democrats has been prompted in part by fears that the only legacy left behind by the Clinton presidency was a collapsing economy. They would have had to worry less if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had boasted far less that this was an economy they themselves had grown. But the now-departed chief exec and veep were merely behaving like politicians. Don't tell the amiable Democrats this, but their worst fears may not be justified. Even if they are, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore deserve only a part of the blame, just as they deserve only a modicum of credit for the economic surge they claimed as their handiwork when the 20th century was going out like a lion. The late 1990s boom was the product of an entrepreneurial, high-tech explosion in which productivity rose dramatically and a new consumer product, the personal computer, came into its own. Last fall, the boom simply ran out of gas after consumers had used up most of their credit and corporations could no longer keep stock prices pumped up by borrowing money to buy up their own shares. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, held in check by Congress, were not able to contribute much to the debacle. That's if you don't count the not inconsiderable regulatory mischief they inflicted before making their rather ungracious departures. Or their resistance to tax-cut proposals that, if enacted a year ago, might have headed off the current slowdown. It's a bit early to grant them absolution, particularly with regard to energy policy, but a little generosity never hurts.
-- For the past six days, the world's political, academic and business luminaries who gathered in this Swiss mountain resort struggled -- between bites of lobster tail and sips of Louis Roederer champagne -- to comprehend the reasons behind growing populist backlash against globalization. At seminars and panel discussions held in a fortress-like conference center surrounded by armed guards and barbed wire, they were confronted by a staccato burst of statistics depicting the monstrous inequalities of our age that more than a billion people live on less than 1 a day, that half of humanity has never made or received a phone call and that Manhattan has more Internet connections than all of Africa. But as they descended today from the snowy alpine peaks, there was an air of disappointment among many of the 2,000 participants who were brought together by the World Economic Forum to ponder how to Bridge the Divides. When people talk about globalization, what we see is a world that is divided into two, said Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president. There is a structural fault of poverty on one side, there are the powerful and the wealthy, and on the other side, there are the powerless and the poor. The exhilarating promises of globalization -- of new technologies, the elevation of living standards through free trade and the global web of mutual interests that was supposed to render wars obsolete -- have given way to fresh suspicions about the need to shatter traditions and break down the last barriers to the flow of capital, people and ideas. Given the growing hostility to globalization, Mexico's new reformist president, Vicente Fox, said the world's industrial democracies need to acknowledge that the present methods of reaching out to the illiterate and the impoverished are simply not working. Instead of bridging the divide, he said, the chasm between rich and poor is only getting worse.
Asian markets generally welcome U.S. interest-rate cuts, but South Korea and Taiwan demonstrate why the Federal Reserve's move won't necessarily translate into parallel action across the Pacific. South Korea's higher-than-expected inflation numbers could imperil the size and timing of anticipated interest-rate cuts, despite the Fed's decision yesterday to cut rates one-half percentage point. At the same time, analysts believe that Taiwan will act more aggressively than the U.S. Fed in easing rates to prevent the Taiwanese currency from becoming too strong. That works to the favor of the Taiwanese stocks, said Shu Yin Lee on the Asian equity sales desk for J.P. Morgan Chase in New York. Shares in South Korea and Taiwan both jumped yesterday with heavy foreign buying setting the pace again. Most other Asian markets also rallied ahead of the Fed move, while the Tokyo market was flat. Most European blue-chip indexes finished higher, though most closed shortly before the Fed action. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.05, or 0.11, to 216.31. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.75, or 1.19, to 159.13. The Fed's rate cut -- combined with an earlier half-percentage-point reduction at the start of the year -- is good news for Asian and other emerging markets whether they follow the central bank's lead or not.
It's been difficult to pin an ideological tail on the nascent Bush White House. One day the president is called a staunch conservative for nominating John D. Ashcroft to run the Justice Department and acting to restrict U.S. funding to overseas groups that support abortions. The next he's labeled a bleeding heart for helping prisoners' children and promoting literacy programs. The problem, some Bush advisers and friends say, is that conventional political definitions do not adequately explain what the president is trying to do. His actions have less to do with the left vs. right, they say, than with his embrace of many of the ideas contained in the movement known as communitarianism, which places the importance of society ahead of the unfettered rights of the individual. This is the ultimate Third Way, said Don Eberly, an adviser in the Bush White House, using a favorite phrase of President Bill Clinton, who also sought, largely unsuccessfully, to redefine the debate with an alternative to the liberal-conservative conflict. The debate in this town the last eight years was how to forge a compromise on the role of the state and the market. This is a new way to rethink social policy a major reigniting of interest in the social sector. Communitarianism, or civil society thinking the two have similar meanings has many interpretations, but at its center is a notion that years of celebrating individual freedom have weakened the bonds of community and that the rights of the individual must be balanced against the interests of society as a whole. Inherent in the philosophy is a return to values and morality, which, the school of thought believes, can best be fostered by community organizations. We need to connect with one another. We've got to move a little more in the direction of community in the balance between community and the individual, said Robert D. Putnam of Harvard University, a leading communitarian thinker. Many of Bush's early proposals fit this approach. This week, Bush moved to make it easier for the government to fund religious groups that cater to the poor and disadvantaged. He also gave a boost to AmeriCorps, the national service program that sends volunteers to help community initiatives. Last week, Bush rolled out an education plan that gave localities more authority over their schools. A week earlier, he spoke of the need for character education in schools. Even his tax plan, due next week, has what are touted as community- building elements a new charitable tax credit, a charitable deduction for those who don't itemize, and a reduction of the marriage penalty. Bush's inaugural address, said George Washington University professor Amitai Etzioni, a communitarian thinker, was a communitarian text, full of words like civility, responsibility and community. That's no accident Bush's advisers consulted on the speech with Putnam. At the same time, Bush has recruited some of the leading thinkers of the civil society, or communitarian, movements to his White House former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith, University of Pennsylvania professor John DiIulio, fatherhood advocate Eberly, speechwriters Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner. Even Lawrence B. Lindsey, long before becoming Bush's economics adviser, was a Federal Reserve governor who explored ways to lure capital to rebuild poor urban communities.
California, birthplace of the high-technology boom that helped carry the nation's economy to new heights, is also setting the national standard for layoffs. But the Midwest, bogged down in a manufacturing slowdown, is catching up quickly. Those are among the highlights of a report released yesterday by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on so-called mass layoffs, where companies terminate 50 or more employees at once, and the employees file for unemployment insurance. The report indicated that while mass layoffs started 2000 little changed from a year earlier, layoffs rose 54 for the fourth quarter from a year earlier as a slowing economy prompted big companies to make sharp cuts in their work forces. In the October to December period, there were 5,248 mass-layoff events involving 647,012 workers, compared with 3,943 events and 420,827 workers a year earlier. For the entire year, there were 15,738 mass-layoff events affecting 1.84 million workers, compared with 14,909 events affecting 1.57 million in 1999. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of the job cuts occurred in manufacturing, which accounted for 35 of all layoff events and 42 of all workers. Virtually everyone has been willing to admit that the manufacturing sector is miserable the question now is whether that weakness spreads out to other areas of the economy, said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. The distribution of mass layoffs on a state-by-state basis showed some surprising results. Partly as a result of an unfolding energy crisis, declining sales of technology equipment and the dot-com blowout, California reported nearly 155,000 mass layoffs for the fourth quarter, a 14 jump from a year earlier. The state also has seen huge job losses in the motion-picture and agriculture industries, although those industries are seasonal and experience heavy turnover.
NEW YORK -- The dollar came under more pressure against the euro and yen after a look at two central-bank decisions -- and the data they were based on -- cast the euro in a more flattering light. Following Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate cut, the European Central Bank decided to leave rates unchanged. Central bank head Wim Duisenberg said that despite the U.S. slowdown, which could constrain global growth, euro-zone fundamentals look broadly favorable. Japanese life-insurance companies and trust investment funds seemed to have come to the same conclusion overnight and were notable bidders for euros, according to Tokyo traders. In late afternoon trading, the dollar was buying 115.58 yen, down from 116.30 yen early in London and 116.37 yen late Wednesday in New York. The euro was trading at 94.14 cents, higher compared with 94.05 cents early in London and 93.66 cents late Wednesday in New York. The euro had a brief spike on the release of the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management manufacturing index, which fell to 41.2 in January, its lowest reading since March 1991.
THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL was a blowout, but at least one group benefited from the boring football match-up advertisers. Viewers last Sunday paid even more attention to the ads that aired during the big game than they had expected to, according to a Wall Street JournalHarris Interactive poll. Harris Interactive surveyed 2,948 people online before the Super Bowl about whether they planned to watch the big game and the ads, and about their overall impression of Super Bowl advertising. The pollsters went back to those people after Sunday's game to find out if they watched the hyped ad campaigns as closely as expected. The pollsters conducted a total of 938 postgame interviews. As the Baltimore Ravens routed the New York Giants, just 52 of the respondents said they stayed tuned for every second of the game, compared with 71 who said they planned to watch the whole thing when asked before the game. Just as many respondents -- 52 -- said they watched every second of advertising during the game, even though only 39 had planned to stay tuned in through all the commercial breaks before the game. Still, fans overall were slightly disappointed by this year's advertising face-off. When this year's Super Bowl ads and those of previous Super Bowls were rated, the ads of Super Bowls past came out on top. On a scale of one to seven, with one being very negative and seven being very positive, this year's ads rated an average score of 4.7. That compares with an average score of 5.2 when respondents were asked their opinion of ads from previous Super Bowls, in general. As further proof, 22 of respondents asked after the Super Bowl said they found the ads annoying, compared with the 16 of pregame respondents who described the ads that way. And only 39 of postgame respondents said the ads made the game more enjoyable, compared with 51 of pregame respondents who said that.
For two charmed years, California Gov. Gray Davis has been riding the political equivalent of a perfect wave a resounding vote into office, huge budget surpluses, a friendly legislature, rivals in disarray and glowing public reviews. Now, just as he is emerging as one of the nation's most prominent Democratic leaders, Davis is caught in a political riptide jeopardizing his career. The lights in the nation's richest and most populous state are barely on. Its biggest utility companies are broke and buried in debt. The Internet giants of Silicon Valley are nervous. Consumer groups are livid. Even Democratic lawmakers are questioning some of the governor's moves. And President Bush, whose campaign flopped here last fall, has no plans to come to the state's rescue. There is no easy escape from California's energy meltdown and little time to resolve the crisis before it gets worse. Desperate to end almost daily brushes with blackouts and silence his skeptics, Davis just patched together a 10 billion plan to keep power flowing into the state. Next, he has to find a way to keep utilities that have more than 25 million customers solvent.
Jasper Becker is Beijing bureau chief for a Hong Kong newspaper, the South China Morning Post, which covers China more extensively than any other English-language paper does. Reporting from China most of the time since 1985, he has been everywhere and asked every question. A few years ago he published a well-regarded book on China's great famine of the 1960s. Now he has pulled together much of his own reporting and that of his Post colleagues to offer a corrective to the outside world's generally sunny view of China today. Becker focuses first on poverty-stricken minority peoples living in regions distant from the coast and on peasants in hilly and dry regions. Then he moves chapter by chapter to the cities, and up the ladder from factory workers to private entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and finally the top leaders. As he gets closer to the coast and to Beijing, he brings consumerism and intellectual sophistication into view. He emphasizes how recent China's consumer revolution is, and throws doubt on the argument that the Internet and faxes will pry Chinese society from the grip of the authoritarian state. A common view in the West -- and a principle behind the China policies of both Bush pegrvre and Bill Clinton -- was that economic opening and growth would improve human rights in China. Becker shows that this optimism has been largely unjustified. Beneath the back- slapping, banqueting and cell-phone networking of private-enterprise China he sees the pathologies of a sick society unemployment, nepotism, corruption and political repression. Many Chinese are worse off, even though GDP per capita has increased. The welfare system has collapsed, the state enterprises are even hollower than they're commonly understood to be, workers have lost job security, and the traditionally dismal terms of trade between the countryside and the cities have worsened. Private entrepreneurs flourish at the sufferance of the state but fall victim to predatory officials and shifts in government policy, and even on the most optimistic projections cannot create enough jobs to soak up China's surplus labor power. Police repression has tightened The individual freedoms bruited in the West are restricted to matters of lifestyle, which do not include politics or religion. The 600 million Chinese peasants, says Becker, are the largest unenfranchised group in the world. Becker's reporting is at its best where China is at its worst. Even among specialists, I do not think the collapse of China's health system has been portrayed as incisively as Becker does it here. He is convincing on the sorry state of rural education, although I think he underestimates strengths at the university level, and he is scathing and correct on the often overpraised reforms of the justice system. Some details Becker gets wrong. It's not fair to say that China has annexed the South China Sea or that China acts as if it has no international obligations other than to ethnic Chinese. It's not true that the National People's Congress has no permanent staff or offices or that Deng Xiaoping had no official post in 1989 except chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association in fact, Deng's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission was crucial to his role in the events of that year. The prediction that Taiwan will help fund the Chinese democracy movement and hence determine China's future strikes me as misguided in two ways -- because the Taiwanese avoid involvement in mainland politics, and because change is more likely to come from within the ruling Communist Party than from the dissident movement.
WASHINGTON -- America's extraordinarily low unemployment rate is beginning to feel pressure from the sharp economic slowdown, but not enough to prove the entire economy has followed manufacturing into recession. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 in January, its highest level since September 1999 but only a bit above the near-30-year low of 4 in December, the Department of Labor said Friday. In January, the labor pool expanded faster than the number of new jobs that were created. Payrolls outside of farming jumped 268,000 in January, adjusted for seasonal variation, well above what economists expected, and a big improvement over the tiny increase of 19,000 jobs in December. That increase was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 105,000. The January data suggest that employment, especially in construction where 145,000 jobs were added, had been unusually depressed by bad weather in December. The report was the first comprehensive look at the entire economy for January. Previous reports had found that the industrial sector's decline accelerated during the month, and the payroll report provided further confirmation. Manufacturing jobs sank by 65,000, bringing total losses in that sector to 254,000 since June. But employment in retail trade, government and other services rose 183,000. It's clear you have a dichotomy between manufacturing and the rest of the economy, said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., noting that service-sector employment would have been higher but for the loss of jobs at temporary-help agencies, many of which were actually at manufacturing companies.
MANCHESTER, Vt. -- Months after her school fund-raising campaign ended, Jenny Davis still sees only two kinds of people when she drives around town those who donated and those who didn't ante up a dime. She knows who's who because the campaign maintains a file on every property owner in town. There are people who are just freeloaders, says the 38-year-old mother of two. It's hard to look at those people in the same way. School fund-raising in this mountain resort town of 3,600 is anything but a friendly drive for new band uniforms. For parents such as Ms. Davis, it is a crusade to protect the town's children and keep local tax dollars out of the hands of state bureaucrats. Manchester's no-holds-barred campaign for private donations to the public schools is making it an unusual battleground in one of America's great debates what to do about unequal school funding. Property taxes, the main revenue source for local governments, have traditionally provided the primary funding for schools. But since the early 1970s, lawsuits in 45 states have argued that districts where property is expensive end up with the best-funded schools, creating illegal inequality. In 20 states where judges have agreed -- and in a handful of others -- legislators have tried to share the wealth. Some states now use statewide property or sales taxes to pay for a greater proportion of their school costs. Others, facing the added pressure of antitax initiatives, cap the amount of local property taxes that a district can raise.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., already the biggest lender in the private-equity arena, wants to launch a 13 billion private-equity fund that would be the largest ever of its kind. The bank's private-equity investing division, once known as Chase Capital Partners and now called J.P. Morgan Partners, is looking for 5 billion of capital from outside investors such as pension funds, endowments and foundations, and will commit 8 billion of its own cash, according to the fund's confidential offering memorandum. Chase's prospective contribution is believed to be the biggest sum ever contributed to a single private-equity fund by any individual organization. If the bank is successful in raising the money, the new fund, dubbed the Chase Capital Global 2001 Fund LP, would dwarf not only the growing multitude of venture-capital funds with 1 billion to 2 billion ready to invest but even Thomas Lee's just-raised 6.1 billion buyout fund, now the largest private-equity fund. Private-equity funds invest in leveraged buyouts, start-up companies and other kinds of private deals. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Chase declined to discuss the fund or comment on it. Raising capital for the new fund could be rough, despite J.P. Morgan Chase's strong track record of annualized returns of 40. The bank's plan comes at a time when rounding up investors for such initiatives has become much tougher. Backing hot technology companies produced eye-popping returns for many private-equity firms in the late 1990s and early last year. Those funds then used those high double-digit or triple-digit returns as a way to persuade institutional investors to boost allocations to private equity.
President Bush has pitched his tax plan, which he unveiled yesterday, as a matter of fairness for overburdened American families, emphasizing how much he would deliver for middle-income Americans. But, no matter how the data is sliced in the upcoming debate in Congress and the country, most of the tax cut dollars go to wealthier Americans who in fact pay the majority of income taxes. The bigger problem for middle-income Americans since the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s has been the payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare, which actually eats up much more of a worker's paycheck. Payroll taxes are not addressed by Bush's 10-year 1.6 trillion tax cut. Because 80 percent of federal income taxes are paid by the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans, they would receive the biggest tax cuts under any plan that cut overall rates. Administration officials argue that giving Americans a tax credit against payroll taxes is a troublesome concept because it effectively means someone is not paying for benefits they will later receive. We have concerns about that, said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser. That's not paying the Social Security tax.
HONG KONG -- Asian airline stocks took a beating when oil prices rose in August and investors bet that soaring fuel bills would soak up industry profits. Many airlines lost more than a quarter of their value in seven weeks. Those bearish investors weren't far off the mark South Korea's two airlines said last week that the huge increase in fuel costs had pulled them into the red for 2000. Now, even though fuel prices have fallen 19 in the past two months, caution is still the watchword for airline stocks among analysts and investors. Shares in blue-chip companies Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways have fallen over the same period, at times as fast as fuel prices. In yesterday's trading, Asian markets were mixed as interest-rate sensitive stocks helped propel Hong Kong higher, while Tokyo slumped for the fourth straight session. European markets were generally higher. That left the Dow Jones World Stock Index down 0.25 point, or 0.12, to 213.43. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.44 point, or 0.28, to 156.64. A big problem for Asian airlines is that the torrid growth that rapidly revived their financial health starting in mid-1999 seems to have run its course. For many of the region's carriers, load factors, or the share of seats and cargo space sold, started falling in the last quarter from historic peaks reached in mid-2000.
NEW YORK -- Investors took out their disappointment with networking giant Cisco Systems' quarterly results on the company's stock -- and on the shares of its numerous rivals and vendors. Cisco itself faded to a 52-week low, thanks to a 4.69 decline that brought its shares to 31.06 apiece as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The selloff came after Cisco put out quarterly results that missed analysts' projections, and warned that its revenue isn't likely to grow for the next six months. In addition, a host of the communications-parts makers that sell gear to Cisco also saw their prices fall sharply. Applied Micro Circuits dropped 5.25 to 49.81 a share, PMC-Sierra declined 7.81 to 58.75 a share and Xilinx gave up 2.50 to 48 a share, all on Nasdaq. Other networking concerns also faded. Foundry Networks fell 1.56 to 17.94 a share, Extreme Networks slid 4.44 to 31.69 a share and Sycamore Networks tumbled 3.31 to 23.69 a share, all on Nasdaq. Electronics makers also lost more ground. Sanmina eased 1.88 to 36.25 a share and Flextronics fell 2.94 to 33.94 a share, both on Nasdaq, while Jabil Circuit declined 2.29 to 31.36 a share.
A large investor in AT&T Corp., as well as the union representing 35,000 of the company's employees, is asking other AT&T shareholders to reject the telecommunications company's proposed breakup plan when it comes for a vote in May. In a conference call with institutional investors who hold about 20 of AT&T's stock outstanding, representatives from the AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of America said the plan to break AT&T into four separate pieces is flawed and will hurt investors in the long run. The AFL-CIO, through its Capital Stewardship Program, works with 1,500 union-sponsored pension funds that collectively hold 25 million AT&T shares. Other participants in the call included representatives of banks and public-employee retirement funds, among others, who together hold 680 million of about 3.75 billion AT&T shares outstanding. Michael Garland, of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, told the investors that AT&T's decision to break the company into pieces was prompted by management's inability to execute on its original strategy of selling a bundle of telecommunications services. Faced with a sharp decline in its big consumer long-distance business, mounting debt from a host of acquisitions, as well as a plunging share price, AT&T said in October that it would split into three stand-alone entities wireless, broadband and business services. The company's consumer long-distance business will be paired with its Business Services unit and trade as a tracking stock.
NEW YORK -- Retail issues faltered, joining high technology as a source of pressure on fading market averages. Shares of Talbots dropped 6.95 to 46.80 each, while AnnTaylor Stores fell 1.31 to 26.39 a share and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1.29 to 29.86 a share. The losses came after a rival apparel retailer, Gap, reported disappointing January same-store sales figures, and warned that it didn't expect to live up to fourth-quarter profit forecasts. Gap shares retreated 2.95 to 26.61 each. Other retailers' share prices also contracted, including some that acquitted themselves relatively well with January sales totals, despite contending with aftereffects of the sluggish end-of-year sales season. Wal-Mart Stores, for example, fell 2.36 to 52.30 a share and Federated Department Stores dropped 2.96 to 42.98 a share. The retailers' declines also exacerbated the lingering pressure from the tech sector, which continued to deal with fallout from Cisco Systems' downbeat quarterly profit statement earlier this week, particularly as it related to inventory problems for communications hardware. Cisco surrendered 1.06 to 30 a share at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, while also inflicting some collateral damage on the market, as chip maker Applied Micro Circuits Nasdaq declined 3.06 to 46.75 a share and electronics maker Jabil Circuit gave up 1.21 to 30.15.
Corrections & Amplifications THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE asks that issuers wanting to list on the exchange have three years of profits, which add up to at least 6.5 million in total. A Deals & Deal Makers article yesterday incorrectly said the exchange asks for market capitalizations of that amount. The required market cap for companies that are joining the exchange from other markets is 100 million. WSJ Feb. 14, 2001 The stock of ETrade Group Inc. goes to its new home this week, and its former stock-market landlord is still steaming. As announced last month, shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., online brokerage firm will leave the Nasdaq Stock Market on Thursday and start trading on the rival New York Stock Exchange. Many companies have left Nasdaq for the NYSE over the years, of course, but this defection is particularly sensitive -- and not just because it's the first one of 2001 or because ETrade has been a Nasdaq stalwart since its initial public offering of stock in 1996. Why does it grate on Nasdaq Officials at the electronic marketplace say they're still irked at how ETrade chose to break the news to them.
The electricity market in California has swung over its history from monopolization by industrialists in its early days to comprehensive regulation, then to partial deregulation in the 1990s, and now back toward substantial regulation and government intervention. In the past, each swing of the pendulum came from public frustration with the way this market operated, and each produced a result that the public again found unsatisfactory. But the memory of politicians and the public is short. The state is poised to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle of regulation. Measures passed by the California Legislature this month are an ill-conceived intervention that will lock the state into high energy costs and put it at a competitive disadvantage for years to come. Unless there is further action, the state will maintain subsidized retail prices that discourage conservation, while capping in-state wholesale prices in a manner that discourages construction of new in-state generation capacity and leaves Californians at the mercy of out-of-state generators. Government subsidization of electricity consumption will drain tax revenues that might be better used for education and other needs, encumber California's children with debt to pay the state's energy bills, and threaten the state's future ability to sell bonds for public projects. The immediate political cost of consumer outrage from higher electricity rates may be postponed, but the real economic cost promises to be massive. The sad thing is that this is all unnecessary. The source of the crisis was rigid regulation of retail prices in the face of rapid increases in wholesale prices driven by increased fuel prices and increased demand in the national electricity market. The only effective solution to the crisis is to make retail price regulation more flexible, so that consumers see the real economic cost of electricity and respond to high prices through conservation efforts that reduce demand and push prices down. On the supply side, the state should encourage construction of new in-state generation capacity through the right market signals, giving producers the opportunity to site plants and sell power under conditions comparable to other states.
Frederick County's farming industry, once the area's primary economic engine, is in decline and needs help from the county to stay competitive, according to a report presented to the Board of County Commissioners. Total farm sales dropped 20 million between 1990 and 1997, from 163 million to 143 million, according to a report commissioned by the Frederick County Office of Economic Development. The number of farms in Frederick County dropped nearly 10 percent, from 1,439 in 1987 to 1,309 in 1997, the study found. Agriculture remains a large and extensive industry, with some sectors showing some stability and growth, the report concluded. But despite some signs of improvement, the study said, the local farming economy continues to suffer from similar economic woes as the U.S. farm economy. The report, the county's first comprehensive study of agriculture, attributes drooping sales to rising farming costs, shrinking commodity prices and a decreasing amount of farmland, much of which has been gobbled up by development in recent years.
NEW YORK -- Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks rose solidly, although both groups saw intraday gains pared sharply by the end of the actively traded session. The Nasdaq and small-cap markets were driven higher by a rally in technology stocks following release of Ciena's fiscal first-quarter results. The fiber-optic networking-systems company posted earnings that beat analysts' projections, and raised its 2001 revenue-growth forecast. Ciena surged 16 to 89 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Ciena's outlook contrasts starkly with many recent quarterly earnings reports, which have been characterized by warnings that revenue growth is expected to slow for the first half. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 61.51, or 2.47, to 2552.91, after posting an intraday gain of 101.69, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks, at 508.85, gained 5.36, or 1.06, having been up as much as 6.53. Rare Medium Group surged 56 cents, or 24, to 2.88. The New York Internet-consulting and venture-capital company reported a fourth-quarter loss that was the same as its year-earlier loss, with revenue rising 66. Analysts said the stock was bolstered by takeover speculation after the company's chief executive reportedly said the company was being approached with strategic options that we are evaluating very seriously.
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's highflying economy lost altitude quickly during last year's fourth quarter, with output here growing a modest 5.1 amid weaker growth in the U.S. Economists had expected a result closer to 6. Despite the late slowdown, figures released yesterday showed Mexico's economy easily beat the government's 4.5 target to grow 6.9 for the year as a whole, its fastest annual growth since 1981. The economy was helped by oil prices at a decade-high, a growing U.S. appetite for Mexican exports, and spending by Mexican consumers who enjoyed wage gains greater than price increases. This year's outlook under new President Vicente Fox Quesada is more uncertain, thanks to a recent drop in oil prices and a fast-slowing U.S. economy, where roughly 85 of Mexican exports are sold. Industrial output for December, the latest barometer of activity, slipped slightly after double-digit growth for much of the year. Some economists welcome a slowdown as a way to prevent prices from rising too quickly. But they note that the drop in industrial output doesn't necessarily mean that Mexicans are spending less. If spending on imports remains strong while Mexican factories export less, they note, the trade deficit could widen, weakening the currency. A slowdown for Mexico is inevitable, said economist Gray Newman at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The risk is that production slows substantially and spending does not.
Careful analysis of the surge in U.S. productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s suggests the gains aren't simply the result of strong overall economic growth, Federal Reserve governor Edward M. Gramlich said yesterday in a speech in London. Instead, the new, higher rate of growth in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- appears likely to last even as economic growth slows, Gramlich said. After the speech, he told reporters that U.S. productivity growth was still accelerating in the first nine months of last year, the Dow Jones news service reported. When economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, productivity growth did as well, but only modestly. So it looks like productivity is hanging in there even with our slowdown, the Fed board member said. Gramlich told the International Bond Congress that numerous studies indicate that the long-term trend in productivity growth increased in the United States from about 1.5 percent annually during the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s to about 2.5 percent more recently. That acceleration was caused primarily by two things, he said.
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has tapped Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's financial-market troubleshooter as the administration's emissary to a jittery Wall Street. Peter Fisher is no stranger to the kind of turmoil he would likely face as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance. In his current job as executive vice president in charge of markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the 44-year-old Mr. Fisher watches global credit and currency markets for potential signs of trouble. Associates describe the red-haired, cherubic Mr. Fisher as an activist willing to use the government's powers to pre-empt or snuff out financial trouble. In 1998, he engineered the controversial Fed-brokered bailout of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, persuading skeptical regulators that the alternative could have been an international financial meltdown. Mr. Fisher would join a Treasury team that is facing its first potential financial crisis in Turkey's emergency devaluation of its currency. Though Mr. Fisher has yet to get formal White House clearance, Mr. O'Neill has settled on him as his choice, according to people familiar with the nomination. His appointment would require confirmation by the Senate. Neither Mr. Fisher nor a Treasury spokeswoman would comment. The Fisher choice underscores the tremendous influence that Mr. Greenspan seems to be building in the new administration. The Fed chairman worked with the new Treasury secretary during the Ford administration, and Mr. O'Neill has frequently turned to his longtime friend for advice on economic policy. Mr. Greenspan also appears to have succeeded in persuading the Bush administration to reappoint Roger Ferguson as Fed vice chairman.
Robert Galvin, Motorola Inc.'s legendary former chairman, plans to resign this spring from the board, marking an end to his more than 60-year reign at the technology and equipment giant. Mr. Galvin's departure comes at a time when his son, Motorola Chief Executive Christopher Galvin, is under tremendous pressure to prove his management mettle in what is turning into one of the most challenging chapters in Motorola's 73-year history. The elder Mr. Galvin has been a staunch supporter of his son's efforts to turn the company around. The Schaumburg, Ill., firm Friday warned that a severe slump in orders and sales could result in the company's first quarterly loss in 16 years. It was the second earnings warning issued during the past six weeks. Motorola blamed the decrease in orders on the slowing economy, but it also is clear that the company has made a number of missteps that have contributed to its problems. Alarmed investors drove down shares of Motorola more than 6, or 1.04, to 16.25 as of 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Corrections & Amplifications FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of Dallas president Robert McTeer was interviewed by Nightly Business Report on a program that aired Monday on PBS. An article on the Politics & Policy page yesterday incorrectly said the interview was with PBS-TV. WSJ Feb. 28, 2001 WASHINGTON -- In a break with tradition, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will modify his testimony on the economy to a House panel tomorrow from what he gave to its Senate counterpart two weeks earlier. Some time has passed since the last testimony so he's updating the text, a Fed spokesman said. Stocks rallied in part on hopes that the changed testimony somehow increases the chances that rates will be cut before the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's decision-making body, meets March 20 -- and that Mr. Greenspan will signal that this week.
-- Buyers took back control of Wall Street today on a bet that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates before its March 20 meeting. Blue chips soared and technology issues recorded more modest gains as the market temporarily set aside worries about the economy. The advance gained momentum after former Fed governor Wayne Angell, now a Bear, Stearns economist, expressed optimism that such a rate cut would indeed occur. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 200.63 at 10,642.53. The 1.9 percent gain represented the Dow's biggest one-day point increase since Jan. 3, when it rose 299 points. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 45.99, to 2308.50, a 2.0 percent increase, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 21.79, or 1.8 percent, to 1267.65. The market has some hope that the Fed might move this week, said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates. The second thing happening here is that I think the market was really oversold. You tend to get a snapback after that.
Consumer confidence fell this month to a level usually seen only during recessions as American households' expectations about their economic future plunged, according to a report released yesterday. Two other reports on last month's new orders for durable goods -- such as cars, appliances, computers and machinery -- and sales of new homes, showed much less weakness and were not nearly as disturbing to analysts as what has been happening to consumer attitudes. Falling stock prices, high heating bills, worries about job prospects and a drumbeat of gloomy statements about the economy from Wall Street analysts, company executives and the White House have taken a big toll on consumers' expectations. If they were to pull back on their spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic output, the already weak economy could slide into a recession. The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell to 106.8, down 25 percent from its level of five months ago. But the overall index is a composite of two measures of how consumers regard their present economic situation and what they expect it to be like six months from now. The present-situation index has declined 10 percent since September, while the expectations reading has plunged 40 percent. The erosion in consumer confidence continues to be fueled by weakening expectations regarding business and employment conditions, said Lynn Franco, director of the board's Consumer Research Center. While the short-term outlook continues to signal a severe economic downturn, consumers' appraisal of current economic conditions suggests we are still undergoing moderate economic growth and not a recession.
NEW YORK -- The euro bucked recent trends by gaining against the dollar even as weak euro-zone data and solid U.S. economic data pressured the common currency. Traders generally shied away from dollar buying as U.S. stocks continued to sink on more profit warnings and little hope of immediate relief from monetary easing. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony Wednesday quelled talk of an intermeeting interest-rate cut, but still left a fog of uncertainty over the U.S. economic landscape. The dollar was little changed against the yen as yen-negative implications of the Bank of Japan's surprise rate cut Wednesday and a 201.88-point drop in the Nikkei 225-stock Index yesterday squared off with yen-supportive continuing repatriation flows. Traders are building euro positions because they don't want to miss any abrupt move upwards, said Michael Donahue, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Fimat USA in New York. There is continued concern by overseas holders of U.S. equities, Mr. Donahue said, adding that if stocks couldn't find support soon, the euro could build momentum toward parity with the dollar.
NEW YORK -- Some Merrill Lynch & Co. executives used to mock the viability of online stock trading. Now, one of the firm's top executives is poised to run Ameritrade Holding Corp., one of the nation's largest online brokerage firms. Joseph Moglia, a senior vice president in Merrill's private-client group, is expected to be named chief executive of Ameritrade, according to people close to the matter. The announcement could come as early as today. Mr. Moglia didn't return a telephone call for comment, and Ameritrade spokesman Larry Marchese declined to comment on the matter. Mr. Moglia would take the post vacated in August when Tom Lewis resigned. Since then, Ameritrade's founder, J. Joe Ricketts, has served as CEO, but he told shareholders at the recent annual meeting that he is looking forward to handing the job over to a permanent chief executive. The move, though, is somewhat ironic given Merrill's past opposition to online trading. The former head of its brokerage business, John Launny Steffens, was once quoted disparaging what he called the do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet trading.
Orders to U.S. factories fell 3.8 percent in January to their lowest level in 14 months, fresh evidence that manufacturers continue to struggle during the economic slowdown. But another report showed that growth in Americans' productivity - - or output per hour of labor -- while slower, was still solid in the fourth quarter despite the sharp economic slowdown. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the January decline in factory orders, which followed a 0.6 percent increase in December, was led by a sharp drop in demand for airplanes, cars and other transportation equipment. Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders fell 0.3 percent, the third decrease in the last four months. Factory orders rose 5.3 percent, the largest increase in a year, in the category of industrial machinery orders, which include those for computers. That followed a 3.2 percent decline in December. January's overall performance was slightly weaker than the 3.5 percent decrease many analysts were expecting. The decline pulled orders to a seasonally adjusted 366.5 billion, the lowest level since November 1999.
WASHINGTON -- Chronic shortages of high-tech and other skilled workers are starting to ease in many parts of the country as layoffs rise and job-hopping abates, a Federal Reserve survey found. The findings could mean unemployment, which edged up to 4.2 in January but remained near a 30-year low, could rise further. February's unemployment rate will be released tomorrow. The Fed report, known as the beige book, suggests demand has eased, mostly for the best-paid workers -- those in high-tech, Internet, manufacturing, and construction jobs -- while demand for entry-level, clerical and health workers has remained strong. The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, uses the report on business conditions around the country to help set the direction for interest rates. The FOMC is expected to cut interest rates by half a percentage point when it meets March 20, an expectation that appeared validated by the Fed report's finding that most regions reported sluggish to modest economic growth in February. A month ago, a Fed survey found a substantial portion of banks tightening lending standards, a development that could exacerbate the current slowdown. And yesterday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told bankers in a speech that, in their zeal to make up for overly lax lending, they should not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit to borrowers with credible prospects.
The outlook for a strong spring grew dimmer for the nation's big retailers today as they reported generally disappointing results for February. While many value-oriented retailers and some clothing stores, such as Talbots, did well, other merchants, most notably department stores and apparel retailers, including Gap, languished amid slowing consumer spending. Analysts said it was clear that consumers, who have been spending cautiously since last June, continue to retrench. This is the new reality that we are going to most likely see going forward, said Michael P. Niemera, vice president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. He added that this was the most store chains he has seen reporting declines since July 1996. February is not a major contributor to retailers' profits, but it does reflect consumer psychology. Stock market volatility and high energy prices continue to plague Americans, and their confidence as measured by the Conference Board fell in February to its lowest level in more than four years.
The nation's unemployment rate remained at 4.2 percent last month as job gains in construction, several service industries and government more than offset the loss of 94,000 manufacturing jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Analysts said details of the report indicated that many employers, other than factories, are reluctant to lay off workers, probably because they expect the current period of very slow economic growth to be short. To be sure, manufacturing is in recession, but the rest of the economy is alive and kicking, said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Bank. Even in autos, where two-thirds of the layoffs in manufacturing have occurred, 13,000 more jobs were created last month. Adjusted for the volatility in weather, construction is in the process of stabilizing and gaining momentum, Sohn said. Services, which account for about 80 percent of jobs, are healthy. Health care, mortgage banking, retail, computer services and call centers have added jobs. Even with the loss of factory jobs, overall payrolls rose by 135,000 last month, more than expected after a gain of 224,000 in January. Those figures are up significantly from the 52,000 a month average in the fourth quarter of last year.
In the homestretch of the presidential campaign last October, I wrote a column noting that earnings warnings were suddenly papering Wall Street, By the time you clearly need a stimulative tax cut it's too late to get one through the congressional labyrinth, it observed. A good time might be right now. Perhaps Alan Greenspan had stopped tightening just in time to engineer a soft landing, I speculated, but if this rosy scenario did not materialize he may be short of maneuvering room. Oil prices were already signaling that a downturn could well be accompanied by a danger of inflation. So if George W. Bush actually won, his tax proposal may be on the table none too soon. This has pretty much worked as advertised, except that it's too bad George W. Bush didn't propose a stimulative tax cut. Well of course, the tax proposal President Bush sent to Congress is the same one candidate Bush had on the table in October. And with its attention to across-the-board marginal rate reductions, it certainly was a stimulative one when compared with Al Gore's tax proposal, a hodgepodge of spending programs in drag. But the economic downturn has become much clearer. Perhaps the economy will yet rebound in the second half leading indicators rose in January after three months of decline, and Friday's employment figures were encouraging. Still, with earnings declines and even layoffs spreading, stimulus soon would be only prudent. The Fed stepped up to the plate by lowering its short-term interest rate target, but the president has made no similar adjustment in his tax proposal. In the current environment, its long phase-in can no longer be overlooked. Experience warns that tax cuts usually stimulate only when they become effective. A phase-in creates incentives to delay income, perhaps making a downturn worse.
There goes the sunshine theory. After a week's correlation between rain, sleet and snow with falling stock prices out of Wall Street, the sun shone over New York yesterday and . . . the DJIA went off 436 and the Nasdaq crashed through 2,000. Needless to say, we don't credit any of this with the New York Times spinning out two front-page stories Saturday that President Bush will dilute the cut in the top tax rate and sign Al Gore's version of the Kyoto Treaty. Well, we try to be cheerful if possible, and in the spirit of could-be-worse, we'll let the U.S. gulp air today and turn our attention to modern economic history's longest near-death experience Japan. We read that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori is actually being kept in his post so as not to disrupt a March 19 working visit to the White House. In the Noh play of Japanese politics, Mr. Mori will be permitted to wear the mask of leader a while longer to disguise the internal discord. Alas, the divisions in Japan's body politic are there for all to see. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comment last Thursday that state finances are near collapse must be taken as a sign of his growing frustration with the Liberal Democratic Party's failed attempts to jump-start the economy with trillions of yen in neo-Keynesian spending. With the LDP apparently bereft of ideas for fixing the economy, Mr. Mori's meeting with the Bush team could prove important. Even if the Japanese PM is a lame duck, American advice will be conveyed back to the inner circle. While Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill hasn't publicly lectured the Japanese as the Clinton brain trust was wont to do, he no doubt recognizes that a deep crisis in Japan would have a huge impact on the U.S. economy. So what advice should he offer Even among those who recognized the futility of Japan's deficit spending, there has always been much disagreement over what should replace it. Monetarists and some demand-side economists have emphasized the damage that deflation and deflationary expectations have done to the economy. Since both inflation and deflation are monetary phenomena, adjusting the supply of money is the key to the problem. So they advocate printing money so that deflationary expectations would be erased, even at risk of a small dose of inflation.
GENERATIONS OF VISITORS to Disneyland have been thrilled by Circle-Vision, an immense circular theater with a 360-degree screen that surrounds the audience with you-are-there movies. Those who can't make the trip to the theme park might want to check out BeHere Inc., a Silicon Valley startup that has what might be the next-best thing. BeHere sells a camera lens and software system that allows most sorts of cameras to take live 360-degree pictures. The company says these images can be put to any number of uses on the Web, in building security systems, and in a new generation of interactive television to allow viewers to be immersed, for example, in a sporting event. The five-year-old company was founded in Cupertino, Calif., by Ted Driscoll, 48 years old, a Stanford University computer science Ph.D., entrepreneur and inveterate tinkerer who developed its core technology. Last year, Andrew L. Thau, 35, a former senior vice president at Fox Sports International, came on board as chief executive. Mr. Thau set about boosting the company's ties to the broadcasting industry he opened an office in Los Angeles, though the company will keep its research-and-development operation in Silicon Valley. The idea of giving Web surfers and others a 360-degree view of something isn't new. Numerous sites afford a circle-style view of, say, the inside of a house that is for sale. A number of companies, such as Internet Pictures Corp. and RemoteReality Corp., are supplying the necessary technology to make that happen, though some of the companies currently sell only still cameras. Mr. Thau says BeHere's system allows a camera to take a moving, rather than still, 360-degree picture that has a seamless image. There are no fissure marks where separate pieces of the circular scene are pieced together to form a whole. What excited me about the company was that the technology was unique, Mr. Thau said. I spent seven years at Fox Sports, and if I was still there, this is something I would be willing to use and pay money for.
If you are planning to retire in the next few years, should you lighten up on your stock investments after a bad year in the market This is a key question for people who are hoping to retire soon but wondering how their nest eggs will hold up if stock prices fall still more or rise only feebly in the years ahead. After five glorious years of 20-plus annual returns, the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year sank 9.1 including dividends, its worst year since 1977. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.2. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market posted its steepest dive in history, shedding 39 while some Internet stocks fell much harder. The answer is that there is no single answer No cookie-cutter solution fits all. It may well be time for people nearing retirement to cut back on stocks, but it wouldn't be smart to do it in one fell swoop. The right move for you depends on several factors, notably your age, your life expectancy and -- this is key -- whether you have enough cash on hand to avoid dumping stocks at low prices if you encounter more bad stock-market years immediately after you retire. To provide some guidance, Encore talked with a number of financial advisers who specialize in retirement. Here's what we found The Lessons of History
Wall Street is counting on Federal Reserve officials to lower their target for overnight interest rates today by three-quarters of a percentage point to help the hapless stock market regain its footing and keep the economy from sliding into a recession. Wall Street may well be disappointed. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has promised that the central bank will respond aggressively to the abrupt slowing of U.S. economic growth, but it's far from clear exactly what that means in the swirling crosscurrents of the U.S. and world economies. Furthermore, the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, has most often changed its rate target in quarter-point increments, and a half-point could be considered aggressive. A survey of 121 analysts and economists completed yesterday by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial markets research firm, found that nearly two-thirds of them believe the Fed will cut the 5.5 percent target by only half a point. Less than a third are looking for three-quarters, while a half dozen said the Fed would slash rates by a full percentage point. I think they are going to go half a point, said Charles Lieberman, chief economist for Advisers Financial, a money- management firm. The recent economic data actually suggest some improvement in the economy. Consumer spending has been better than expected, including for cars, and auto companies have boosted production plans for the second quarter. A larger cut could lead some people to conclude that The Fed must know about some problems that we don't, and then the markets might sell off even more, Lieberman said. And I don't think they will want to encourage anyone to think they are doing it to support the stock market.
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration may be having its cake and eating it too when it comes to government projections about economic growth. As the White House pushes its big tax-cut package, administration and congressional budget analysts predict boom times ahead that would generate giant revenue surpluses. But in a recent trustees' study on the solvency of Social Security and Medicare -- programs President Bush has targeted for major retooling -- the administration paints a picture of modest economic growth and flagging worker productivity. Some officials say this is largely a consequence of having separate bureaucracies prepare the economic forecasts for the budget and for the big entitlement programs. But the policy-making implications can be dramatic. For example, if the Social Security trustees' assumptions are basically correct, the overall budget surplus predicted by the Congressional Budget Office could drop by as much as 1.75 trillion from its current projected 5.6 trillion -- or about the amount Mr. Bush is seeking in his tax-cut package, economists said.
Markets across the world suffered one of their worst days in months as mounting concern about an economic slowdown punished stocks in every sector. While global investors have been dumping technology and other growth-oriented shares for many months, the declines highlighted how the damage has spread in recent weeks to parts of the market traditionally considered relatively safe. Before this month, people said they wanted safe-haven stocks, said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist for CIBC World Markets in Toronto. Now they don't want any stocks. Yesterday's selloff, which occurred before the end-of-the-day rally in the U.S., was particularly intense in Europe, where all the major blue-chip indexes fell 4 or more, and in Latin America, where markets in Brazil and Argentina each declined more than 5. Most Asian stocks also foundered. Hong Kong blue-chips lost 4, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average skidded 2 and Singapore's benchmark index fell 2.6. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 1.87, or 3.36, to 176.60. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 3.53, or 4.80, to 131.01.
Washington, which gave birth to telecommunications competition 25 years ago, is now leading that industry toward its Darwinian climax. A ruthless restructuring has moved into its final phase in the past 10 days as three local telecom companies threw in the towel, starting what is projected to be the biggest industry implosion since real estate developers took down the savings and loan industry a decade ago. E.spire Communications Inc. of Herndon has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Metrocall Inc. of Alexandria says it may have to do the same. PSINet Inc. of Ashburn is trying to avoid it, but isn't given much chance by industry insiders. More local companies are lined up behind them. Each of these companies was set up to serve a different piece of the telecommunications market. E.spire was into local and long- distance voice. Metrocall sold wireless paging. PSINet's specialty was high-speed Internet services. Stockholders of this trio of companies have seen 14 billion in stock market value wiped out. Investors stuck with 5 billion worth of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds issued by the companies are expected to collect only pennies on the dollar for their debts. These are the first victims of an epidemic that by some estimates could wipe out more than a thousand telecommunications providers in the next few years.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Fannie Mae has threatened several large financial services firms that had opposed Fannie's interests in Congress. According to statements by the CEOs of AIG, Wells Fargo and GE Capital Services, they, or their firms, were told that Fannie would withdraw its business from them if they remained active in FM Watch, an organization that seeks to limit Fannie's expansion beyond its traditional role in the secondary mortgage markets. Fannie's chairman Franklin Raines, as well as a Fannie spokeswoman, have both denied that such threats were made, but when CEOs of major companies go public with statements of this gravity they must be taken seriously. This is not an ordinary commercial dispute, since Fannie Mae is not an ordinary company. Along with its smaller cousin, Freddie Mac, Fannie enjoys a government charter authorizing it to help create liquidity in the residential mortgage markets by purchasing mortgages from banks and others and guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities. Although both Fannie and Freddie are now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, they have so many links to government -- including a special line of credit at the Treasury -- that they are called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. As a result, the capital markets do not believe they will be allowed to fail, and provide them with financing at a rate only slightly higher than the Treasury's own borrowing costs. With this government backing and financial advantage, Fannie and Freddie have grown to enormous size and profitability. Today, they carry on their books the credit risk of over 40 of all residential mortgages in the U.S. and are by far the most dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. It is fair to say that if a company is denied the opportunity to sell its mortgages to Fannie or Freddie, or the opportunity to underwrite or deal in Fannie or Freddie securities, it will suffer serious financial harm. If Mr. Raines or Fannie did threaten these companies, that is the reason why his threat was menacing. Fannie Mae is to the residential mortgage markets what Microsoft is to computers, with one major exception Fannie enjoys government backing. Fannie's market power derives from its government connection -- from the fact that it holds, in effect, a government monopoly. A threat from Fannie's chairman, then, is roughly equivalent to the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board threatening to ruin a bank that opposes the Fed in Congress. Such a threat would be seen as a serious matter, out of order for a government official and considerably more serious than the threats that Microsoft is alleged to have made against rivals. This episode should alert us to dangers inherent in GSEs. They are sometimes praised as providing private-sector efficiency in the pursuit of government policies, without direct government expenditure. Unfortunately, the true costs are hidden or deferred. In the mid-1980s, Congress had to spend billions to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. And the costs are often not simply financial. While we value the aggressiveness and efficiencies of private enterprises in their pursuit of profit, when these characteristics are hitched to the power of the government through a government-granted monopoly, they can dominate and distort otherwise competitive markets.
Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry yesterday proposed increasing school spending by 59 million, which would fund a teachers' raise, two new elementary schools and about 40 new guidance counselors. The 1 billion school spending plan was a key part of Curry's annual budget presentation, a proposal he touted for containing none of the service cuts or tax increases contemplated in neighboring areas. That's a whole lot of zeroes, Curry D said at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, referring to the money for schools. Nevertheless, the school increase was far less than the 158 million boost that Board of Education officials had requested. And Curry's proposal contained no money to reduce class sizes, something that Schools Superintendent Iris T. Metts listed as her top priority. Curry said it would be unwise to spend money on hiring more teachers to cut class sizes when there isn't enough classroom space. But school board members, who had requested 11.5 million for the initiative, say it can be accomplished by assigning two teachers to a single class.
ASIAPACIFIC Japan's Production Declines by 2.1 Amid Global Slowing Japan's industrial production in February dropped 2.1 from a year earlier but was up 0.4 from January, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The year-to-year monthly decline, the first since the spring of 1999, underscored the slowdown in manufacturing amid Japan's declining exports and the slowing global economy. The 0.4 month-to-month rise was a modest bounce from a record 4.2 decline in January, and was much weaker than economists' consensus forecast of a 1.7 rise. METI said it expects output this month to fall 0.8 from February, putting production on track to drop 3.3 for the January-March period -- the first quarterly decline since the spring of 1999 -- before a predicted 0.6 rebound in April.
Prime Minister Tony Blair enjoys a booming economy and enviable public approval ratings, but his decision on whether to call a national election for May has been complicated by the crisis surrounding the foot-and-mouth epidemic on Britain's farms. Under the parliamentary system, Blair can choose the date for national elections. He is said to be eager to dissolve Parliament and hold an election quickly, with May 3 as his preferred date. Blair has to decide by Monday, and he's receiving conflicting advice from across the political spectrum. A choice that once seemed almost automatic has suddenly emerged as a crucial test of Blair's political instincts and courage. While most members of Blair's governing Labor Party appear to favor a May election, several have joined the call for a delay until the farm crisis has been controlled. William Hague, leader of the chief opposition Conservative Party said today that a May election would be an arrogant choice that puts the interests of one party ahead of the country. In the rural communities worst hit by the epidemic, farm groups are bitter at the very thought of a May election. There's a sense that he's throwing us over the side to advance his own political agenda, said Mike Downham, a livestock farmer in the northern county of Cumbria. Rural voters generally don't back Labor, so Blair presumably wouldn't lose many votes if he angered farmers. But if city and suburban voters decide that it is callous to mount a campaign during a crisis, that could cost the Labor Party votes it badly needs, both in the parliamentary election and in the hundreds of city and county elections also scheduled for May 3.
How should new retirees invest their savings so they get the income they need to help support them during a 15- or 20-year retirement That advice may sound a bit crazy, given the huge losses that so many stocks, including mine, have suffered during the past 12 months. Looking at the carnage on Wall Street, new retirees may wonder why anyone would tell them to get deeply involved in stocks. But that is precisely what some financial advisers suggest. The reason, of course, is that the advisers are not reacting to what the stock market is doing at the moment they're talking about what the market is going to do in the next 15 or 20 years. History is clear on this point. Sooner or later, stocks will recover and prices will rise. When that happens, stocks will again generate the gains that retired investors need for their long-term financial health. Of course, for older retirees who invest in stocks, it's hard not to worry. Thus far, my stock losses are still on paper. But I will admit that, at the age of 74, it is pretty scary to realize that if I had to sell some of my battered stocks anytime soon, my paper losses would become actual losses. I sometimes wonder if I should dump my stocks and flee to bonds. However, experience has taught me that it would be a bad idea. When you sell at the bottom, you lock in your losses. And then, when the market turns around and those stocks go back up, you no longer own them and you don't get any of the gains. So you lose both ways.
WASHINGTON -- Americans' income and spending moderated in February but may still be growing enough to keep the economy from tipping into a recession. Personal income edged up 0.4 in February, the Commerce Department reported Friday, while personal-consumption expenditures rose 0.3. January income was revised to a gain of 0.5, down from the 0.6 pace previously estimated. Consumer spending in January was revised to a gain of 1, up from the 0.7 gain first reported. In another indication that consumers may be counted on to keep the economy growing, even while manufacturing flails, a widely watched barometer of consumer confidence rose in March after three months of declines. The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index, which measures current and future economic expectations, rose to 91.5 last month from 90.6 in February, according to people familiar with the report. Analysts had expected a lower reading because of the recent stock-market turmoil. But a separate report Friday gave further evidence of the sharp slowdown among U.S. businesses. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of business activity in the Midwest fell to 35.0 in March, its lowest level in 19 years. Any number below 50 signals that business in the manufacturing sector is contracting. Analysts had expected a reading of 43.5, slightly higher than the 43.2 level reported for February. The Chicago survey is widely watched for indications of the index of the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose March report will be released today.
CARTERET, N.J. -- Pathmark Stores Inc. said it posted a profit before reorganization and other items for the fiscal fourth quarter of 13.6 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, mainly because of the opening of new stores and renovation of existing locations. Including the reorganization and other items, the supermarket chain reported a net loss of 48.5 million, or 1.62 a share, for the period ended Feb. 3. For a year earlier, Pathmark posted a loss of 2.5 million, or eight cents a share. Results in the recent quarter are a combination of two different entities formed because of the company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection in September 2000. Sales for the period climbed 11 to 1.06 billion from 956.1 million. Aside from an extra week in 2000, a company spokesman said the increase was driven by strong holiday sales, the opening of four new stores and renovation of 19 stores in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas.
Although the reasons behind Thursday's surge were a bit of a mystery, there were plenty of reasons for stocks to retreat yesterday -- reports of rising unemployment, more profit warnings and the bankruptcy filing of California's biggest utility. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 126.96 points to close at 9791.09, after soaring the previous day to its second-largest daily point gain. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 64.64, to 1720.36. The stock market's broadest measure, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell 23.01, to 1128.43. For the week, the Nasdaq dropped 6.6 percent, the S&P 500 declined 2.9 percent and the Dow fell 1.1 percent, despite the frenzied buying on Thursday. Thursday's rally was severe, said Michael W. Clark, head of equity trading for Credit Suisse First Boston, who said the sell-off yesterday was a logical reaction to that. The bottom line, he said, is that the underlying trend hasn't changed. Yesterday morning, the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent in March, the highest it has been in 20 months. Worse, businesses cut 86,000 jobs, the biggest one- month reduction in payrolls since 1991.
The collision between a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter last Sunday has left Chinese President Jiang Zemin caught between Chinese expectations for an apology and Washington's refusal to deliver one, Chinese and Western analysts said today. China's continued insistence on a full apology carries substantial risks for the Chinese president, officials associated with him and for China, the analysts said. Jiang really doesn't have many cards to play, said one Chinese political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. By setting his price so high for the Americans -- an apology -- he is probably going to fail, whatever the outcome. Jiang and the rest of the Communist Party are in a struggle over who will lead China into the future. A misstep by Jiang while simultaneously managing relations with the United States and dealing with potential opponents at home could result in his being eased from the political stage, Chinese officials speculated. Thus, the Bush administration must decide how much it wants to bolster the 74-year- old technocrat, who has made strong U.S.-China relations a hallmark of his government. More broadly, China is seeking to reunite with Taiwan, an island of 23 million people 100 miles off China's coast that Beijing has claimed as its territory since 1949. And it hopes ultimately, according to a report last year by the U.S. Defense Department, to replace the United States as the main power in Asia.
Persistent inflation risks kept the European Central Bank from trimming interest rates -- despite a slowing economy, intense political pressure and market expectations of a cut -- and the bank signaled that any reduction wouldn't necessarily come soon. I specifically don't want to introduce a bias in our public utterances or statements, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said at a news conference. So you keep on waiting and we keep on seeing. Mr. Duisenberg further brushed off pressure to cut by saying a series of seven rate increases up until last October resulted in the disappearance of inflationary risks over the medium term. But having achieved that does not mean that we have to also reverse the course. Rate cuts in the U.S. and Japan three weeks ago, coupled with a softer tone on inflation from some of the ECB's most influential officials, sparked speculation the ECB would trim at least a quarter point from its key rate of 4.75 at yesterday's meeting. Now economists believe the ECB will keep rates steady until May or even June, remaining the only major central bank to stand still in the face of the global slowdown. The ECB sets interest rates for the 12 nations using the euro -- the world's second-largest economy. The decision disappointed those investors who believe the ECB is sacrificing too much growth for low inflation. Within minutes of the ECB announcement, the euro fell a half cent to 88.4 U.S. cents. Two hours later, the common currency hit a low for the day of 88.1 cents. Late in New York trading, it was quoted at 88.75 cents, down from 88.81 cents late Tuesday.
Tosco Corp., in an effort to boost lackluster retail gasoline profits, has begun raising wholesale gasoline prices in Southern California and Arizona, two markets where it has significant market share. Service-station dealers in California and Arizona say that since March 26, Tosco has raised wholesale prices to its dealers that market under such brands as 76 and Circle K by between six cents and 16 cents a gallon, depending on the area. As a result, dealers say they are paying substantially more than their competitors for gasoline, forcing them to either boost retail prices or sustain losses. It isn't clear how long Tosco will hold out, however, if competitors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. don't match the increases. We will pursue every business practice the market will allow us to do. If the market doesn't allow us to do something, we can't do it, said Jefferson Allen, Tosco's president and chief financial officer. Tosco, a refining and marketing company based in Old Greenwich, Conn., agreed in February to be acquired by Phillips Petroleum Co. for about 7 billion, and shareholders of both companies yesterday approved that deal. Although Tosco posted record profit from refining operations in the fourth quarter, much of that achieved in California, the company says marketing income has sagged. So far, competitors haven't matched the price increases, but Tosco dealers and others in Arizona and Southern California believe they must be tempted. Gasoline spot prices, or the wholesale prices paid in the daily spot market for gasoline at the refinery, have been soaring in the states, and Tosco says it has lost money from marketing operations in the region for nine months. Gas stations have been unable to push through price increases in the fiercely competitive market.
Brace yourself. Over the next several weeks, hundreds of U.S. companies will report profit-and-loss statements that are going to look ugly. According to analysts' estimates gathered by Thomson FinancialFirst Call, operating profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 declined 9 in the quarter ended March 31 from the year-earlier period. If the estimates hold up, it will be the sharpest drop since the 1990-91 recession. Second-quarter earnings are also expected to tumble 7 and the third-quarter outlook, while still barely positive, is rapidly deteriorating. That's a big departure from 1999 and 2000, when year-over-year quarterly operating profits frequently grew more than 20. But some economists say the current decline doesn't begin to tell the full story of what's in store in the coming years. They say that even once the economy rebounds and earnings start growing again, the outsized profit gains of 1999 and 2000 are a thing of the past. Profits in the 1990s, they say, grew out of sync with the rest of the economy, lifted temporarily by tame debt and labor costs, accounting quirks and technology investments that might never yield significant returns. They say a reversion to the mean is in the works that will translate into a period of profit gains that, at best, are in the single digits. And if consumers cut back on spending in response to their stock market losses, it will only add to the profit pain.
Suppose your federal government dramatically slashed tax rates for the well-to-do, all in the name of promoting economic growth. Suppose, too, that it is running a budget deficit and plans to do so for at least the next several years. You might assume that you live in a country governed by a bunch of reckless right-wingers, willing to risk the nation's economic health for the benefit of a tiny fat-cat constituency. In fact, you reside in socialist Western Europe. Though most of Europe's countries are ruled by left-of-center governments, taxes are coming down across the Continent. Not only are tax-loving countries like the Netherlands and Sweden cutting rates, but so are economic heavyweights like France yes, France and Germany. Meanwhile, the only major industrial country that is running a large budget surplus, but where apparently respectable people still claim that it can't afford a major tax cut, is the U.S. Viewed from a European perspective, America's epic tax debate is strange indeed. Of course, Europe's tax cuts aren't nearly as big as they might be, and opposition parties have vowed to push through bigger relief if they regain power. Yet measured by the standards of American liberals, countries like Germany are about to enjoy irresponsible tax relief. Indeed, the tax cut that Berlin started to phase in at the beginning of this year is bigger than President George W. Bush's controversial 1.6 trillion plan.
ExciteHome, issuing its second warning this year, said its first-quarter results would be weaker than expected due to a continuing falloff in the advertising market. The Redwood City, Calif., company, which provides high-speed Internet access over cable, said its revenue for the quarter would be significantly lower, even as its operating loss increases and its available cash is decreasing. Excite officials said the company expects to lose 14 cents to 15 cents a share in the first quarter, including certain charges, compared with a 13-cent loss that was expected by a consensus of Wall Street analysts compiled by Thomson FinancialFirst Call. The company estimated that revenue in the period will be between 140 million and 145 million. Excite said its cash has dropped to 105 million as of March 31, compared with 201 million at the end of 2000. It said it has executed a nonbinding agreement for its controlling shareholder, AT&T Corp., to contribute 75 million to 85 million by restructuring a pact related to improving Excite's high-speed backbone fiber network. Those services are a valuable asset for Excite, since broadband usage is growing. The company said its subscribership rose to 3.2 million in the first quarter, up 16.
For anyone with an interest in the Great Depression, certain phrases set off chills. So when Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, declared this week that economic recovery was just around the corner, he must have been unaware that he was paraphrasing Herbert Hoover. The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Wednesday may, temporarily anyway, restore some of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's popularity. Accused of foot-dragging on the matter of priming a sluggish economy, Greenspan now seems in a full-speed-ahead mood to get things moving again. But the Fed's action also is a sign of how worried the economic masters of the universe are about our nation's slowdown. In the dry language of Fedspeak, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. If a good inflation-phobe like Greenspan believes this, it's hard for anyone to disagree. The question is whether our sustained national experiment with very low unemployment is about to end. The unemployment rate has spiked up, and the news of layoffs suggests the numbers are likely to get worse this year. For all the media focus on stock prices, it's unemployment that has real human and social impact. With all those cable stations running the market ticker at the bottom of their screens all day long, it's hard to remember that in the economic lives of most people, stocks play a limited role. As David Leonhardt of the New York Times put it this week, Relatively few Americans rely on them for a significant portion of their income. It's an antique notion, I know, but jobs really matter.
Federal Reserve officials are no strangers to criticism. They've heard all the barbed complaints about how the central bank takes away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, and thousands of home builders once sent then-chairman Paul A. Volcker short pieces of lumber to protest the impact of high interest rates on their industry. In more recent months, as the economy has stalled and the stock market has tumbled, letters have poured in to the Fed from individuals complaining bitterly that the central bank's actions over the past two years have ruined their retirements by driving down share prices. And even though the Fed has aggressively cut interest rates since the beginning of the year, many economists, politicians and business executives are complaining that it waited too long to begin lowering rates and that they are still too high. Until parts of the stock market began to head south a year ago, Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials were being hailed as geniuses. The economic expansion that began in early 1991 had become the longest in American history, and in an unusual twist, non- inflationary growth had accelerated as the expansion aged. The growth of productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- appeared to have shifted into a higher gear, raising U.S. living standards in the process. And the nation's unemployment rate was down to nearly 4 percent, a rate previously believed possible only in a world of increasing inflation. And that low rate meant that many Americans with fewer skills and low incomes were able to find jobs where none had been available before. The major stock indexes began slipping, and the nation's economic growth fell suddenly and sharply late last year to a 1 percent annual rate. It apparently hasn't done much better since.
NEW YORK -- The prospect that the Federal Reserve could avert a recession through its aggressive easing of monetary policy is tolling a bearish knell for Treasurys. Last week, the Fed unexpectedly cut interest rates by a half percentage point, its fourth rate reduction of that size this year. That pushed the Federal funds rate, or overnight bank lending level, down to 4.5. Bond investors always fear that returns on fixed-income securities such as Treasurys could be eroded in the long term if stronger growth is accompanied by higher inflation. Thus, in their view, what's good for the economy isn't necessarily healthy for the Treasurys market. Reflecting such fears, the 30-year Treasury bond Friday ended at about its highest yield of the year so far, or 5.793. Its price, which moves inversely to its yield, was down 332 point from late Thursday at 94 132. Meantime, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 232 point, or 62 cents per 1,000 face value, at 97 2632. Because of the small change in price, its yield ended unchanged from Thursday at 5.279.
What next from the folks who gave the world the morbidly named guaranteed minimum death benefit There isn't a guarantee, but analysts think life-insurance companies that specialize in selling variable annuities are facing rough times -- rough times that could lead to earnings disappointments -- in the form of slowing annuity sales and some variable-annuity policy benefits that are suddenly in the money. Companies such as Hartford Financial Services Group, Lincoln National and Nationwide Financial Services saw assets in variable annuities, which are essentially mutual funds in an insurance wrapper, shrink last year, due to poor stock-market performance and, for most companies, shrinking net sales figures. And unlike securities brokerage firms and mutual-fund firms with stock-market exposure, insurers have an added layer of risk. In recent years, many have essentially locked in certain levels of stock-market returns of their policyholders. Now, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq Composite Index 20 and 59 off their highs of last year, respectively, some of those promises are coming back to haunt the sellers. The biggest earnings bite for variable-annuity sellers comes from the declining sales and assets under management. Variable-annuity net sales fell to 45.3 billion last year from 64 billion in 1999, according to the Vards Report, an industry newsletter. Morgan Stanley issued a report earlier this month estimating variable-annuity sales declined another 14 in the first quarter, and predicting a further 10 decline this quarter. In the same report, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Dally says the sales decline would make it difficult for Lincoln National to achieve its goal of positive net cash flows in its individual variable-annuity business by year end. Failing to do that, he wrote, could be a disappointment to the market. In recent weeks, analysts have cut Lincoln's first-quarter consensus earnings estimate to 90 cents from 94 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research.
Surveying, with undisguised distaste from the mist-shrouded peaks of the New York Times op-ed page, the union hacks and Starbucks anarchists who sought to disrupt the Quebec trade summit last week, globalist-pundit Thomas L. Friedman sniffed the anti-globalization movement is largely the well intentioned but ill informed being led around by the ill intentioned and well informed. What the ignorant and malign anti-globalists do not understand, Friedman lectured, is that global trade expansion is the only route out of poverty for the world's poor -- not only a commercial good but a moral one too. Friedman's assessment is important because he is as close as there is to the voice of the globalization establishment. The establishmentarian view, as it has evolved in the face of increasing criticism, is that globalization is great not only because it creates wealth in the developed countries but because it functions as a sort of super-missionary, spreading both wealth and freedom among the less blessed nations of the earth. Last week in Quebec, George W. Bush summed up the perceived wisdom We seek freedom not only for people living within our borders but also for commerce moving across our borders. Free and open trade creates new jobs and new income. It lifts the lives of all our people, applying the power of markets to the needs of the poor. . . . And open trade reinforces the habit of liberty. This argument is true as far as it goes. As Friedman's paper is currently reporting in a series on free trade, the blessings of unfettered commerce are a great deal less than munificent but trade does bring jobs -- sweatshop jobs, gutter-level jobs, but still jobs - - to places where there were no jobs before. And, indeed, free trade has historically pulled freedom in its wake although, as China is proving, this need not necessarily be so. The problem with this argument is that it is a very fat herring of the reddest hue. It is beside the central political, economic and moral point of the whole debate. President Bush gave the game away in unscripted remarks on his proposal to create a hemispheric Free Trade Area of the Americas at last, truly the world's largest shopping mall. Addressing demands that participating countries adhere to minimum standards of worker treatment and environmental protection, Bush said the agreement certainly must not contain codicils to destroy the spirit of free trade. He added While I understand that some unionists are interested in making sure there's labor protections, I don't want those labor protections to be used to destroy the free trade agreement.
From Manhattan to Montana, worries are mounting that a California-style electricity crisis could be on the way. The problem is rooted in the nation's piecemeal, poorly thought-out utility-deregulation process, which planted time bombs that could continue to explode across the nation for years to come. Deregulation in the '90s prodded many utilities to sell off power plants and then to sign long-term contracts to buy back the output. Now, those contracts are expiring. That will mean utilities are going to be buying electricity at much higher prices on the open market -- at a time when ownership of power plants is increasingly concentrated in relatively few hands. Another big problem The transmission lines that carry electricity are growing old and overloaded. But in the chaotic world of deregulation, few have sufficient financial incentive to upgrade the lines. The result In some parts of the country there may be no way to deliver enough power when and where it's needed most. While the rest of the country is in better shape than California, some ominous clouds are already gathering. Supplies in several regions are tight. Prices are rising sharply, affecting not only consumers in the 24 states that have already been deregulated but even some in states that haven't. An ill-timed heat wave from Maine to Pennsylvania could plunge parts of the Northeast into a power crisis. The breakdown of a few big power plants in the West could reverberate through nearly a dozen states. Whole chunks of the country, in other words, are balancing on the knife's edge between scant sufficiency and outright shortage, says Douglas Logan, a principal at energy firm RDI Consulting in Boulder, Colo.
Most stocks held up better than many investors anticipated when this week began, even though technology shares succumbed to more profit-taking. Following 10 days of almost unprecedented gains earlier this month, there were widespread expectations that stocks would fall more heavily than they have. The Nasdaq Composite Index did fall 1.21, or 24.92 points, to 2034.88 yesterday. But on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks rose than fell. Led by old-style industrial stocks such as Alcoa and DuPont, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.63, or 67.15 points, to 10692.35. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 0.47. Although the Nasdaq composite still is down more than 17 so far this year -- and 60 off its record high, set last year -- the industrials are down less than 1 since the year began, just 8.8 off their all-time high, also reached last year.
YOU'VE SEEN the headlines, and they're breathless. An auction of photographs from the Museum of Modern Art raises 4 million in a morning, with 90 of the pictures sold. The La Favorite diamond, a 50-carat bauble, brings 3.6 million. On Monday, a Paul Cezanne mountainscape goes on the auction block and could climb, its investors brag, to 80 million. As the economy slows, the art world seems to be in its own shiny bubble, insulated, giggling and still sipping champagne. It would be nice it if were true. As the huge spring art season kicks off Monday, with a dizzying two weeks of million-dollar auctions and gallery openings in New York City, collectors may indeed be opening their checkbooks wide, particularly for cutting-edge contemporary art, but they're buying scared. What's selling and what's going to sell well are the blue-chip Picasso portraits, the Matisse sure-things, the still-wet, still-cheap new art and, in effect, anything and everything that's been owned by somebody famous or that the Museum of Modern Art has said is all right to buy. It's May 2001 Meet the neurotic collector, the still-wealthy buyer of art who'll only do it if his friends, his broker and even art history agree he's doing the right thing. Money is still going into art hand over fist, particularly into contemporary art, but collectors want the Prozacs of paintings works so good, so rare or so enveloped in deafening buzz that even a 10 million purchase seems safe. Consider Walker Evans. This gifted photographer of the Depression-era South has a cult following, but never had the prices or household-name recognition of Ansel Adams. Then both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art held shows of his work at the same time. Last week, he was the stellar success of a MoMA sale, with his works selling for as much as 171,750 even though, as photographs, they weren't one-of-a-kind. How come A collector couldn't ask for a greater comfort level than to buy works by an artist the two biggest art-world gorillas fought over.
The U.S. economy shed nearly a quarter of a million jobs during April, the government reported yesterday, all but dashing hopes that the economic slowdown that began last summer had nearly run its course. The unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent in March, with 6.4 million Americans now out of work and looking for jobs. Most forecasters expect the jobless rate to rise to 5 percent by the end of the year. April's decline in payroll employment, the second in a row, was the biggest monthly drop since the last recession a decade ago. Many analysts and policymakers worry that continuing corporate layoffs and hiring freezes will cause consumers to pull back sharply on their spending, tipping the economy into recession. The fallout from a deteriorating job market on consumer spending hasn't kicked in yet, and when it does, it won't be pretty, said Allen Sinai, a leading economic forecaster. However, investors saw in the news an encouraging sign that businesses were moving aggressively to cut costs, trim excess capacity and return quickly to profitability. Stock prices rose on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and New York Stock Exchange see story, Page E1.
For years, the Hopkins Candy Factory in Old Town Manassas was little more than a crumbling property and a dream. The same could be said of a parking lot a block away where a granary once stood, a lot considered to be one of the city's most enduring eyesores. On Wednesday, Mayor Marvin L. Gillum R ceremoniously presented these two pockmarked properties as the new anchors of Old Town the Candy Factory, soon to be a center for the arts, and the abandoned corner at Center and West Streets, soon to be the City Square Pavilion and ice skating rink. City officials and project boosters streamed out of their offices, slapping each other on the back, shaking hands and talking merrily about the future. But getting to this point has been a long and arduous process for city officials and community leaders, who formally began discussing these projects more than five years ago. In that time, they have debated prices, purposes and architecture. They have watched both projects' costs increase and looked for federal, state and private funding. Progress slowed to a point where supporters of both projects were worried. And at times some of the city's most influential personalities have clashed over the Candy Factory's future, the design of the City Square and how the high-visibility projects would get funding from a sometimes skeptical City Council. These were huge, complicated projects that were being considered, said David Flach, president of Historic Manassas Inc. HMI, the group that has been mainly responsible for the pavilion. The council was very deliberative, and I think at times some of us wondered what the outcome was going to be.
SINGAPORE -- Singapore's reputation as a haven for those seeking solid, if not spectacular, gains took a hit in the first quarter, as the market's main index fell more sharply than all others in Southeast Asia. But that doesn't mean investors should shift to higher-risk, potentially higher-return Asian markets, fund managers and analysts say. Instead, they say, investors need to study what has changed in Singapore companies while maintaining a long-term view. Those with a distant horizon and stock-picking acumen have found Singapore a good investment, they say. Singapore's Straits Times Index was closed yesterday for a holiday, as other major markets in Asia finished higher. Continental European markets were generally higher, while London was closed for a holiday. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.01 point, or 0.01, to 199.28. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.58 point, or 0.40, to 146.77. The first quarter proved that during global selloffs, the redundant phrase safe haven doesn't exist for stocks. The only safe haven is cash -- or utilities in Hong Kong, says Sean Darby, regional strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. And some analysts and strategists aren't sure all the bad news has come out. Merrill Lynch has been underweight on Singapore for more than a year. And analysts believe that changes due May 19 in Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes will cut weightings for some local companies.
BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. -- Wilsons the Leather Experts Inc. expects to report a net loss of 21 cents to 23 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, wider than the most recent Thomson FinancialFirst Call analysts' consensus estimate of a loss of 12 cents a share. The specialty retailer of leather outerwear, apparel and accessories said first-quarter sales rose 30 to 117.5 million from 90.3 million a year earlier, but same-store sales rose only 2.1, compared with a 7.2 increase for the same period a year before. For last year's fiscal first quarter ended April 29, Wilsons posted a loss of 1.38 million, or eight cents a share. Excluding items, the company's year-ago loss was five cents a share. The retailer also expects to report a loss for its fiscal second quarter of 1.01 to 1.03 per share, which is in line with the 1.01-a-share loss expected by analysts. Wilsons said it expects sales of 106 million to 109 million for the second quarter. For the full fiscal year ending in January, Wilsons said it expects to earn 2.75 to 2.85 a share on sales of 842 million to 852 million. The most recent consensus estimate had seen the company reporting profit of 2.94 a share for the full year. Joel Waller, chairman and chief executive, said the wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss estimate is due to the decision to accelerate the closing of four stores, lower comparable-store sales in April because of the timing of Easter and the performance of its newly acquired Bentley's Luggage Corp. unit.
Corrections & Amplifications GENERAL MOTORS Corp. is offering a nationwide 400 rebate on Chevrolet Cavalier models to recent college graduates. An article Thursday about discounts offered by the Big Three auto makers incorrectly stated that GM had a nationwide, 1,000 college-graduate discount offer on the Cavalier. WSJ May 15, 2001 DETROIT -- The Big Three auto makers, facing fatter inventories and a shrinking market, are sweetening the pot with more discounts, including deals on important vehicle lines. Ford Motor Co. has cut the financing rate for buyers of the redesigned 2002 Explorer, and is offering an interest rate of 3.9 for 36 months, down from the previous 5.9 rate. That means a savings on a monthly payment of 18 to 25, or as much as 900 during the three-year contract. If you want to sell 400,000 Explorers a year, you can't be out in the market buck naked, Ford's chief market analyst George Pipas said. As good as the Explorer is, you've got to provide a good value equation. Ford just launched the redesigned Explorer in April, after a delay of nearly three months to work out potential quality problems.
Rouse Co. of Columbia told investors yesterday that its portfolio of upscale shopping centers and offices remains strong despite the turbulent retail market, and that the company will open several new malls starting next year in South Florida. The developer and owner of commercial properties nationwide said at its annual shareholders meeting that it expects to profit this year from the recent renovations of its malls, including the Mall in Columbia, and future retail construction. More than 600 investors, employees and analysts attended the meeting in a crowded meeting room at the company's headquarters. The company said each of its three operating lines -- retail, office and land sales -- had record performances last year. For the year, Rouse's funds from operations rose 13 percent, to 252.6 million, up from 223.4 million in 1999. Funds from operations is the standard performance measure of real estate companies. The company leased 97 percent of the space in its shopping centers, said chief executive Anthony W. Deering. Rouse announced last week that funds from operations in this year's first quarter rose 12 percent, to 70.5 million, beating analysts' estimates by 9 cents per share, according to a survey by First CallThomson Financial. Shares of Rouse closed at 26.61, up 11 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The excellent results from last year and this year's first quarter should continue, producing strong growth for 2001, Deering said.
With U.S. stock markets in a trading range and still vulnerable to another downturn -- what economists euphemistically call testing the lows -- some investors may be looking overseas as a place to put some money. But while Europe may be a good place to spend a couple of weeks this summer with the euro still weak against the dollar, sending your money there is something else. You may have to wait three to five years before you can bring it home profitably. We have about 60 percent of our money invested there, said David Herro, who manages the Oakmark International Fund. We are buying Europe with the cheap euro. But for true investors, not people who think they can get a quick hit, you have to look three to five years out. Similarly, Joshua Feinman, chief economist for Deutsche Asset Management, part of Deutsche Bank, said I would not encourage people to try timing the market when it comes to Europe. It might be sensible to seek some growth opportunities for diversification outside the United States, if you have a longer time horizon. The creation of the European economic union and the single currency was expected to help countries restructure their economies by making their corporate governance more investor-friendly and developing an individual investor culture. Still, the time frame before the European economy catches up to the United States, especially in changing rigid labor practices, remains long, fund managers and international investment strategists say.
NEW YORK -- Amid signs that the Federal Reserve is near the end of its aggressive rate-cutting campaign, the bond market appears at a turning point. Investors widely expect Fed policy makers, who meet again tomorrow, to cut interest rates once more. But what happens after that is less clear. Many in the market believe any rate reduction tomorrow could be the last the Fed makes in this interest-rate cycle. They cite evidence that consumer sentiment, wages, retail sales and the equities markets either remain fairly strong or are recovering from weakness last winter. The implications are crucial to the Treasurys market, which staged a yearlong rally as the economy and the stock market began to languish and as the Fed cut short-term interest rates by two percentage points in the first four months of this year. If interest rates are near their lows of this cycle, and if the economy finally is stirring in response to the Fed's strong medicine, the outlook for Treasurys is considerably less bright, analysts note.
WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation at the consumer level increased a bit in April, mainly reflecting rising energy prices. The Consumer Price Index rose a slower-than-expected 0.3, after accelerating at an 0.1 rate in March, the Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy items, the core index rose just 0.2, the same as in March. During the 12 months ending in April, core inflation was 2.6, down from 2.7 for the 12-month period ending in March. The government attributed April's faster growth in consumer prices mainly to a 1.8 surge in energy prices, after a 2.1 drop in March. Gasoline prices rose 5, but natural-gas prices fell 1.6 and electricity prices rose just 0.2. Food costs grew at the same 0.2 rate as in March. The government attributed the increase in the core index largely to housing and a rebound in transportation prices. Housing costs grew 0.1 after increasing 0.2 in March. Transportation prices rose 0.9 after falling 0.9 in March.
Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by asset size, agreed to buy Mexico's second-largest bank company for 12.5 billion in stock and cash, the companies announced yesterday. Analysts said the purchase of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival should strengthen Mexico's banking system. The system is still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the 1994-95 peso devaluation and loan crisis that led to a 100 billion government bailout of debt-heavy banks, analysts said. The crisis caused many Mexicans to lose confidence in their banks. Banamex owns Banco Nacional de Mexico, which has assets of 37 billion, nearly 1,300 branches across Mexico and 27 percent of the country's deposits, more than any other bank. Citibank has had a bank in Mexico for more than 70 years, but recently its presence in Mexico has grown more visible, with an increasing number of automated teller machines and branches opening, especially in Mexico City. Citigroup will merge the company with its current banking operations.
The British journalist Michela Wrong takes the title of this chillingly amusing cautionary tale from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, near the end of which the dying white station manager, Mr. Kurtz, cries out against the horror, the horror. It is, as Wrong says, one of the great misquotations of all time, commonly misinterpreted as a protest against black Africa's supposed predisposition to violence. Wrong gets it right The British journalist Michela Wrong takes the title of this chillingly amusing cautionary tale from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, near the end of which the dying white station manager, Mr. Kurtz, cries out against the horror, the horror. It is, as Wrong says, one of the great misquotations of all time, commonly misinterpreted as a protest against black Africa's supposed predisposition to violence. Wrong gets it right When Kurtz raves against 'the horror, the horror,' he is . . . registering in a final lucid moment just how far he has fallen from grace. The 'darkness' of the book's title refers to the monstrous passions at the core of the human soul, lying ready to emerge when man's better instincts are suspended. . . . Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man, than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery. Wrong uses Conrad's theme in her study of the calamitous three- decade reign of Mobutu Sese Seko in Congo -- which Mobutu renamed Zaire -- to say that no man is a caricature, no individual can alone bear responsibility for a nation's collapse. What happened in Zaire had its roots in a history of extraordinary outside interference, as basic in motivation as it was elevated in rhetoric. She is wholly unsentimental about Mobutu, whom she calls brutal, ruthless and greedy, a neighborhood thug, but she also insists that if Mobutu traced a Kurtz-like trajectory from high ideals to febrile corruption, he did not pursue that itinerary alone, or unaided. The story of Congo between Mobutu's rise to power in 1965 and his involuntary departure 32 years later is at once simple and familiar, yet unimaginably complicated, ambiguous and mysterious. On the one hand, it is a tale of a charming, stylish, intelligent, manipulative man who rose from unlikely origins, gained control of his government by unscrupulous means and bled its treasury dry it is a tale that has been told many times, in many settings and with many casts of characters, and it gets no prettier with each retelling. On the other hand, it is a hugely intricate tapestry in which past and present are woven together in patterns that sometimes prove impenetrable a tale involving so many people, organizations and acronyms that sheer bewilderment is the only honest way to respond and a tale upon which it is impossible, in most respects if not all, to pronounce final and confident moral judgment. The legacy of Mobutu and his accomplices is stunning Congo's economy has shrunk to the level of 1958, while the population has tripled. Average life expectancy is fifty-two, 80 per cent of the population is employed in 'subsistence activities' illiteracy is growing AIDS is rife and such diseases as bubonic plague and sleeping sickness are enjoying a vibrant comeback. By the end of the century the government's annual operating budget for what is potentially one of Africa's richest states was dipping below the daily takings of the US superstore Wal-Mart. There are many reasons, but it all comes down to this Mobutu stole Congo blind.
Republicans and a small group of Democrats in the Senate last night turned back efforts to significantly change a 1.35 trillion tax cut package that meets many of President Bush's goals, but were thwarted in their efforts to hold a speedy final vote. The tax bill appeared headed for easy passage by a solid majority, but shortly before midnight the Republican leadership abandoned efforts to complete work on the measure as Democratic opponents succeeded in forcing adjournment for the night. The Senate will resume its debate today, when Republicans said they would have a final vote. We see there is a delay being forced, Majority Leader Trent Lott R-Miss. said shortly before the chamber adjourned. But I think it is very important that we complete this work. As the evening progressed, the Democrats offered a series of amendments as they resisted GOP efforts to quickly push the bill through. They charged that the Republicans were trying to pass the largest tax cut in 20 years in the dark of night. We're going to be here until 6 in the morning at least, said Sen. Max Baucus D-Mont., assessing the stack of amendments awaiting action and asking Lott to adjourn.
TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal posted increased net incomes for their fiscal second quarters as prudence helped them weather the recent economic slowdown and stock-market volatility. Canadian banks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts as the economy has soured, partly because the Canadian companies had less exposure to deteriorating credit. Canadian banks are relatively cautious, said Kevin Choquette, a Toronto analyst with Scotia Capital, the brokerage arm of Bank of Nova Scotia. Credit problems for Canadian banks have also been milder because Canada emerged a year later than the U.S. from the last recession, Mr. Choquette added. That lag gave U.S. banks an extra year to put on more marginal credit, he said. For the quarter ended April 30, Royal Bank, based in Toronto, said net increased 4 to 602 million Canadian dollars US390.8 million, or 92 Canadian cents a fully diluted share, from C578 million, or 89 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Royal Bank's total provision for credit losses rose to C210 million from C172 million in the year-earlier period. Results for the latest quarter included, for the first time, a full quarter of earnings for two recently acquired businesses Dain Rauscher, a Minneapolis securities firm, and the insurance subsidiaries of South Carolina's Liberty Corp. While Dain Rauscher's results contributed to a 42 drop in Royal Bank's wealth-management earnings, the Liberty acquisitions' results fueled a 63 jump in insurance earnings. Personal- and commercial-banking earnings rose 26 to C334 million.
Corrections & Amplifications INVESTORS PLACED 30.77 billion into money-market funds in the week ended Tuesday, bringing net assets to a record 2.045 trillion, according to Money Fund Report, a newsletter. An article yesterday incorrectly said that the 30.77 billion was a record in fact, the net-asset figure is a record. WSJ May 25, 2001 NEW YORK -- A record 30.77 billion flowed into money-market funds in the week ended Tuesday, bringing net assets to 2.045 trillion, according to Money Fund Report, a newsletter. The surge in inflows came from institutional investors, who stashed a net 31.74 billion into taxable money-market funds in an attempt to avoid the most recent cut in interest rates, said Peter Crane, managing editor of the Money Fund Report. Taxable money-market funds are considered temporary havens from interest-rate cuts because of their long maturity of about 52 days. As a result, assets in those funds yield the more appealing returns of former rates. The Federal Reserve cut key federal-fund rates by half a percentage point to 4 on May 15.
WASHINGTON -- Many of the eye-catching benefits for the middle class in the Senate tax-cut bill will phase out after a few years, while breaks for the rich tend to arrive late -- and stay. The bill has been criticized as a legislative hall of mirrors, with benefits that often look bigger, or smaller, than they really are depending on when they take effect and for how long. The basic reason for this The Senate has been trying to cram most of the benefits of Mr. Bush's 1.6 trillion 10-year plan -- along with additional provisions aimed at pleasing middle-class voters -- into a much smaller, 1.35 trillion package. In order to do that, Senators had to push some benefits out to year 11, while starting others quickly, then stopping them after a couple of years. Even some of the bill's most basic breaks arrive slowly. For example, income-tax rate relief begins immediately, but takes full effect only in 2007 estate-tax repeal, tax relief for married couples and the doubling of the child credit all become fully effective in 2011. A new 500 credit for student-loan interest takes effect in 2009. But a new deduction for college tuition abruptly ends after 2005. Ridiculous, said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche in Washington, referring to all the phase-ins and phase-outs. The bottom line is they're stretching to do as much as they can.
NEW YORK -- After an initial flurry of activity in Asian trading, the foreign-exchange market lost momentum as it assessed the implications of the pronounced euro weakness and unexpected yen strength Wednesday. In overnight trading, the dollar followed through on trends established late yesterday in New York and slipped under 119 yen for the first time since early March. Even more aggressive selling pulled the euro down against the yen, to another new 2001 low of just above 101 yen. At that point the market backed off. There were some good bids for the euro against the yen around 101 yen, and with Europe being closed people didn't want to stay too short, said John Cholakis, foreign-exchange dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. With little new data in the U.S. to guide investors and limited liquidity because of the Ascension Day holiday in much of Europe, trading slipped into narrow ranges as traders moved to the sidelines ahead of the long holiday weekend in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In late New York trading, the euro was at 85.72 cents, up from 85.45 cents in London, and slightly lower than 85.65 cents late Wednesday. Against the yen, the euro was at 102.48 yen, after bouncing off its overnight low of 101.04 yen. The dollar was at 119.89 yen, little changed from 119.78 yen in London and flat with 119.89 yen in late New York trade Wednesday. The dollar was at 1.7781 Swiss francs, compared with 1.7789 francs Wednesday, while sterling was at 1.4089, down from 1.4191.
TiVo Inc. said it received an important patent associated with disc-based video recorders but also announced a fiscal first-quarter net loss that more than doubled from a year earlier. Analysts said the patent boosts the prospects for TiVo to get additional revenue from licensing its technologies. TiVo said it already has a licensing agreement with the original equipment makers that manufacture its recorders. But with the patent, it has the right to license its technologies to cable providers, competitors and other companies. In response, TiVo's shares rose 3.56, or 72, to 8.50 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Personal video recorders such as TiVo's record TV programming work in a way that, among other things, let users effectively pause live broadcasts or skip over commercials. The Alviso, Calif., company said the patent covers many of the inventions associated with the devices, including a method for recording a TV program while playing back another or watching a program as it is being recorded a method for processing various multimedia streams such as video and audio at low cost and a storage format that allows users to pause and scan through a live TV broadcast. TiVo could use a boost. The company reported after the market closed that its net loss for the period ended April 30 widened to 49.1 million, or 1.20 a share, from 23.5 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
Stocks edged higher in lackluster trading as traders' attention began to shift to the beaches and barbecues of Memorial Day weekend. On the strength of late-day upticks, the major indexes all finished in positive territory. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.72, or 38.54 points, to 2282.02. The Dow Jones Industrial average rose 0.15, or 16.91 points, to 11122.42. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.32, or 4.12 points, to 1293.17. Volume is expected to be light today, and investors will have the three-day weekend to ponder whether stocks' relatively strong performance so far this week signals a sustained rise. Driving yesterday's market were new economic data showing a decline in April home sales and an increase in jobless claims last week. For the stock market, both were considered bullish signs of low inflation, which could clear the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cisco, Microsoft and Intel all rallied, helping the Nasdaq to post the day's best performance. The index is up 3.8 for the week so far.
BOSTON -- Gaston Bastiaens, a former chief executive of Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV, is set to appear in U.S. District Court here today, after being arrested on a Belgian warrant accusing him of fraud and other charges. Mr. Bastiaens, a 54-year-old Belgian citizen, was arrested Saturday while sunbathing in his backyard in Winchester, Mass., a Boston suburb, said Timothy Bane, chief deputy U.S. Marshal in Boston. L&H, a once highflying maker of speech-recognition and language software, has crumbled in the past year amid allegations of accounting fraud. Internal investigations have concluded that nearly half the reported revenue from 1998 to mid-2000 was fake. The Ieper, Belgium, company is operating under bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Belgium. Its market value, which once approached 10 billion, is almost nothing. L&H co-founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie were arrested in Belgium in April on charges of forgery and stock manipulation, along with a third former company executive, Nico Willaert. Mr. Bastiaens was CEO of L&H from 1996 to August 2000, a period when the company appeared to expand spectacularly through acquisitions and internal growth. Much of the company's growth in 1999 and early 2000 was based on sales in Singapore and South Korea that internal probes found were either fictitious or booked improperly.
Sequenom Inc., a genomics-based biotechnology company, said it will acquire Gemini Genomics PLC of the United Kingdom in a stock swap valued at about 226.8 million, one of the first in what analysts expect to be a series of consolidations among genomics companies. The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects. Both companies also reaped tremendous rewards by making initial public offerings during the 2000 biotech stock-market boom -- and both have also seen their stock prices plummet since then. Sequenom, of San Diego, makes systems for sifting through genetic data in order to pinpoint meaningful genetic differences that might be linked to disease. Gemini, of Cambridge, England, has focused on amassing large databases of genetic data from twins, disease-affected families and participants in drug trials. The two companies struck a research partnership last June, one that has already produced tentative gene candidates linked to heart disease. Under the terms of the agreement, Gemini shareholders will receive 0.2 share of Sequenom in exchange for each share of Gemini stock. Sequenom shares dropped 11 on news of the deal, and as of 4 p.m. traded at 15.75, down 1.93, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts generally applauded the deal, which they suggest is a harbinger of things to come among genomics firms and so-called platform companies, which build systems for processing and analyzing genetic data.
A former corporate client of Credit Suisse First Boston opened a new legal front in the attack on how Wall Street allocates initial public offerings of stock. Creditors of the company formerly known as Mortgage.com Inc., which was taken public during the IPO boom, accused the Wall Street firm, a unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group, of breaching its underwriting contract by obtaining kickbacks in the form of unusually large trading commissions from investors seeking IPO allocations. The suit by MDCM Holdings Inc. -- the entity that survived after Mortgage.com sold its name and Web site address last year for 1.8 million to a U.S. unit of ABN Amro Holding NV -- is a rare effort by a company claiming it was shortchanged in the IPO allocation process, securities lawyers say. Before ceasing operations, the suit says, MDCM was a provider of online-mortgage services. The case marks a twist in the current controversy surrounding the way Wall Street allocates IPO shares. Since December, individuals have filed more than 125 suits against major securities firms, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by seeking, among other things, oversized commission payments from investors who received IPOs, according to lawyers tracking the suits. But the MDCM suit stands out because it represents a corporate client of a Wall Street firm alleging IPO impropriety. Legal actions by corporate clients potentially are more problematic for Wall Street firms because such companies could possess more detailed data about who received their IPO shares.
For much of the last half-decade, the story line for Southern Maryland's economy has been simple Growth, and how to manage it. People have flocked to the region, creating fertile ground for companies of every sort. Now, add this line to the story There are scores of new jobs, but with unemployment rates nearing the lowest level in decades, it can take time to fill them. Southern Maryland's roaring economy has significantly intensified demand for workers, fostering a climate in which prospective employees in some industries can command higher salaries or move to another job. People all over are having these problems. It's real, said Janet Cook, executive director of St. Mary's County's Chamber of Commerce, which recently lost an office manager to a better-paying job at a high-tech firm. The Southern Maryland experience so far relects that of the larger region. While much of the nation is braced for job layoffs as the economy slows, the deep reliance of metropolitan Washington's economy on the federal government appears so far to have shielded it from most of the fallout of any downturn, experts say.
TOKYO -- Japan's economy is showing new signs of weakness, which could make it trickier for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to carry out his promises of corporate restructuring and economic reform. The government is scheduled Monday to report gross domestic product for the first quarter, and most economists expect a flat figure compared with the previous quarter. But a variety of data suggest that the U.S. slowdown is taking its toll on Japan, and that GDP could shrink in the current and third quarters, throwing Japan back into a full-fledged recession. Among the negative signs The index of leading economic indicators has been below 50 for three months in a row, often a harbinger of recession. Industrial production fell 1.7 in April from March. Yesterday, a Ministry of Finance survey of corporate investment suggested slower-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, corporate profits were flat in the latest quarter, after growth of 31.9 in the preceding quarter. It is only a question of timing . . . and not direction -- the economy is heading into recession, wrote Richard Jerram, economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, in a report to clients. Mr. Koizumi says further structural reform, such as clearing up bad loans at banks and eliminating wasteful government spending, will help the economy grow over the medium term. In the short term, however, economists agree that reform will likely damage the economy by increasing unemployment and bankruptcies. Should the economy slow sharply over the next few months, Mr. Koizumi would face increasing pressure to scale back his reform plans, among them his promise to restrain government debt.
After being burned last year by actively managed equity funds focused on technology and the Internet, investors are again pumping money into index funds, seeking broad exposure to the U.S. stock market at the lowest cost. People are less willing to concentrate on specific areas of the market, said Eric Bjorgen, director of research at Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis-based research firm. They're looking for the diversification an index fund offers. Bjorgen said 15 percent of inflows into equity funds this year through May 23 went into stock funds that track broad market indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. That's up from just 4 percent during the same period last year. In the late 1990s, a period when the S&P consistently beat actively managed funds, index funds received about 25 percent of inflows. Because of the devastation in the technology market, mutual fund investors are coming back to some of the traditional, broad-based, old-economy funds, Bjorgen said. The biggest beneficiary of the shift has been Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. provider of index funds. Vanguard, the best-selling U.S. mutual fund group this year, raked in 12.71 billion this year through April, more than double that of its nearest competitor, according to Financial Research Corp., a Boston-based consulting firm.
MCI stock came back from the dead Friday, three years after shares of the pioneering Washington telephone company stopped trading when the company was sold to WorldCom Inc. The resumption of trading means the 47 million merger, one of Washington's biggest ever, was a flop. The new incarnation of MCI is also likely to be a flop for investors, based on what has happened to other companies that have used the financial gimmick that enabled WorldCom to resurrect MCI stock. WorldCom isn't exactly divorcing MCI, but Chairman Bernie Ebbers is doing his darnedest to distance WorldCom's thriving data, Internet and international businesses from the boring, brutally competitive long-distance operations of MCI. In a financial fantasy using an increasingly popular form of pseudo-security, Ebbers is not splitting his company in two, he's simply splitting his stock in two.
United Bank, a West Virginia-based institution looking to increase its presence in the Washington area, yesterday bought the locally owned, 11-branch Century National Bank for 62.5 million. United, with 18 of its 22 Washington area outlets in Northern Virginia, agreed to pay 2 12 times Century's book value. United, with overall assets of 5.4 billion, said the deal will boost it from the 11th-largest bank in both Virginia and the Washington area to the ninth biggest, with 2 billion in assets here. Century's estimated 1,000 shareholders reaped an immediate windfall in the stock market, with its stock jumping 64 percent -- up 5.10, to 13.10. United's stock fell 68 cents, to 23.92. Under terms of the sale, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, stockholders in Century's holding company, Century Bancshares Inc., will receive 0.45 shares of United's holding firm, United Bankshares Inc., and 3.43 in cash for each share of Century they hold, with the announced purchase price at 14.50 per Century share.
Oracle Corp. used cost cutting to offset slowing sales and to edge past profit expectations in a fiscal fourth-quarter report that lacked any big downside surprises, as many had feared it might. The company also cheered investors by making positive comments about its short-term outlook. Oracle's upbeat view of its near-term future, though, doesn't mean a return to the regular double-digit-percentage sales growth the company saw a year ago, when it was busy supplying software for the still-burgeoning Internet and business-to-business sectors. By contrast, Oracle is now predicting that both sales and profit during the next three months will be essentially flat from a year earlier analysts considered that to be good news only because they were worried it might be worse. Oracle's financial report had been much anticipated as an indicator of the overall health of the broad technology sector. Earlier this month, analysts had braced for an earnings preannouncement from Oracle warning of an impending shortfall. While that didn't occur, analysts had still feared there might be some unpleasant surprises yesterday. But none came, a fact that, along with the company's cheery outlook, pushed up the value of Oracle's shares in after-hours trading, following the announcement. Oracle shares rose 8.5 to 16.10 after hours, after falling 16 cents to 14.84 as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares are, however, nowhere near their 52-week high of 46.47, and have fallen just like the stocks of other stars of the 1990s technology-stock boom. Robert Austrian, with Bank of America Securities, said the latest results suggest that Oracle's problems may have bottomed out. Maybe this is as tough as it is going to get for Oracle, he said.
ARE YOU ENJOYING the budget surplus Let's hope so it's disappearing right before your eyes. Nearly everybody in Washington is playing a part in making it evaporate. That isn't what you'll see in the authorized budget numbers, of course. But many of those numbers are at best suspect, and at worst part of a game that makes it easier for both parties to do what they want for short-term political reasons, while ignoring problems that are being sown for the long run. Why this gloomy analysis now Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars. Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests. Third, both parties in Congress already are showing in real life why such plans are at risk. President Bush's own Republicans are busy adding back into spending bills for next year items the White House doesn't want, pleasing fans of apple programs and water projects but undermining budget blueprints.
WASHINGTON -- Corporate America, hurt by the global slowdown, is trying to persuade the Bush administration to abandon the strong-dollar policy that has been a staple of U.S. economic strategy since the mid-1990s. John T. Dillon, International Paper Co.'s chief executive and the new head of the Business Roundtable, pleaded his case at a private meeting with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill yesterday. The dollar's strength against the yen and euro, he said, makes it too hard for U.S. companies to compete with imports and to penetrate foreign markets. There's no question that orders for our products have been off for about a year, and foreign companies are taking an increasing share of the U.S. market, Mr. Dillon said after the meeting with Mr. O'Neill. It's not that their factories are any more efficient than our factories, but they do have a pretty sizable advantage because of the dollar's relationship with other currencies. During the past two weeks, the dollar has surged to 15-year highs both against the British pound -- down to 1.3981 in late New York trading yesterday from 1.4007 a day earlier -- and against a basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners. The euro, which sold for 85.45 U.S. cents late yesterday, is 27 weaker against the dollar than when the 12-nation currency made its debut on Jan. 1, 1999. Mr. Dillon said industrial America is in a deep recession, and that the administration should let the markets know that the U.S. is no longer inclined to prop up the dollar.
These days, economists have plenty to worry about. Add what's happening in Leesburg, Va., to the list. In that Washington, D.C., suburb, real-estate agent Ray Mauk has been trying to sell a four-bedroom, two-story house for the past two months. He figured it would sell in a day or two, given the recent frenzy for homes in the area. But instead, he has been forced to reduce the 395,000 asking price three times -- lowering it by 5,000 on each occasion. The market, says Mr. Mauk, just isn't there. Despite a slowing economy, the U.S. housing market has held strong and is widely credited with having helped to stave off a recession. But in a handful of cities across the country, cracks are starting to appear in the housing market's once-solid foundation. From San Francisco to Minneapolis to Denver, some real-estate agents say demand is slowing and the number of available homes is increasing -- often a sign of weakness. Meanwhile, home builder Centex Homes, a unit of Centex Corp. in Dallas, is offering a 10,000 discount or free amenities on some new homes in the Atlanta area to stimulate demand. And in Dallas, where inventories are up 24 from last year, price reductions are becoming more common. Although home sales overall remain healthy by historical standards, discounting and rising inventories are the indications that usually start off telling me we're going to see a tougher market, says Petey Parker, vice president of Ebby Halliday Realtors in Dallas. It's a different market than it was a few months ago, adds Marsha Sell, a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Buckhead Brokers in Atlanta. Every agent I talk to is experiencing fewer showings on their listings.
Stock prices finally settled on solid gains today after investors spent a wobbly session perplexed by another batch of mixed signals about the economy and earnings. Buyers deemed a better-than-expected report on the economy to be a plus. But sellers fretted over the latest string of analyst downgrades of high-profile companies. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 50.66 at 10,647.33, bouncing back from several dips into negative territory. The market's broader indicators followed the same path. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.58, to 2031.24, and the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index advanced 10.56, to 1223.14. It was the first time since June 7 that all three major indexes advanced. Investors were feeling somewhat optimistic after hearing that the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators, a key forecasting gauge, rose 0.5 percent in May. The reading was better than the 0.3 percent analysts were expecting and a sign that the economy is poised to slowly recover.
Jean-Marie Eveillard is a patient man. As evidence, consider that he runs a gold fund. Founded in 1993, Mr. Eveillard's First Eagle SoGen Gold Fund has languished for much of the past eight years. An investor putting 10,000 in the fund at inception would have a little more than 7,000 today. With declines like that, plus investor withdrawals, the fund's assets have dwindled to 10.9 million from a high of 70.2 million. So it was little wonder that in 1998, Mr. Eveillard publicly pondered closing the thing altogether. He didn't, and during autumn of last year, finally, the fund began to glitter. It has gained 28.35 since the beginning of the year and more than 37 since bottoming out in November. Still, Mr. Eveillard, 61 years old, remains wary. Do I think the recent upturn and then downturn in the price of the metal are significant I don't have the foggiest idea, Mr. Eveillard says. The gold market is a very opaque market.
How many more dashed hopes and false recoveries must we experience before politicians and monetary authorities accept the fact that our inability to manage fiat currencies is causing the global economic slowdown They keep waiting for interest-rate reductions to kick in, yet more than six months after the Fed began lowering rates the economy continues to weaken. Waiting for the recently enacted tax cuts to provide stimulus will prove futile as well. The economy does not suffer a lack of consumer demand, and more money in people's pockets will not revive the supply side of the economy. Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no great nation in history that went off the gold standard and remained great. Since Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem dollars held by foreign governments for gold, we have put that thesis to the test. For the first time in human history, not a single major currency in the world was linked to a commodity. Economist Milton Friedman called the situation unprecedented and said it is not a long-term viable alternative. The world, he said, needs a long-term anchor of some kind. In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. In creating a world monetary system of floating fiat currencies with the stroke of a pen, President Nixon touched off world-wide inflation that lasted through the '70s and early '80s. Yet America recovered to preside over the demise of world communism, and overcame the rising inflation and unemployment of stagflation to enjoy an unparalleled 18-year economic expansion. Today, the U.S. is at the pinnacle of its power and enjoying its greatest prosperity ever. Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong I don't think so. If the U.S. has so far come out on top in this experiment, it is only because other countries' economies have suffered even more from floating currencies.
NEW YORK -- What a difference a day makes, not to mention a meager quarter of a percentage point. That is what bullish gold traders discovered yesterday as they watched the recent gains accrued by the yellow metal wash away in a tide of disappointment. That followed the Federal Open Market Committee's opting to trim interest rates by a conservative quarter of a percentage point instead of the half-point some expected. August gold futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange plunged more than 4 before bouncing to end the session at 270 a troy ounce, 2.80 lower than Wednesday. To be fair, it wasn't the Fed decision alone that pulled the legs out from under gold prices. Even ahead of the announcement Wednesday afternoon, gold had begun to weaken on a selloff in the oil sector. Market watchers are increasingly looking at energies as leaders for other inflation-geared commodities, according to George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities.
When Nobuyuki Idei, chairman of Sony, asked Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony America, to set up a little dinner for various Washington VIPs next month, Stringer enlisted his old friend Sally Quinn, our Post colleague, to help pick a venue and organize a guest list. Quinn suggested using the newly refurbished former presidential yacht Sequoia, docked at the Washington Marina. But when she toured the 106-foot vessel a few weeks ago, she spotted trouble A framed photograph commemorating Japanese Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako's 1975 cruise with President Ford was accompanied by a brass plaque bearing the inscription In 1945, President Harry Truman reportedly decided, while on the Sequoia, to drop the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Quinn immediately asked that the offending plaque be removed, and a new plaque -- omitting the reference to Hiroshima -- was ordered from a Capitol Hill framing shop. Yesterday, after dinner organizers got wind of our inquiries, the order for the new plaque was canceled instead the whole display will be hidden away. Quinn told us My initial reaction was that the whole point of entertaining people is to make them feel comfortable, and it seemed this would be a little insensitive to the guest of honor. One problem resolved, another cropped up during last week's inspection by a Sony advance team The onboard television set is a Sharp. We hear that the Sony folks demanded that it be replaced with one of their own models, but Sony Vice President Anne Murfogen told us she merely asked that the Sharp be stowed. Nobody will be watching TV, she said. We guess a screening of Pearl Harbor is out of the question. Stringer, meanwhile, told us We're throwing a party for the chairman of Sony, who has rarely been in Washington, and we thought it was a great opportunity for him to meet politicians, business leaders and journalists -- that's all. Among the invited guests, we hear, are Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of State Colin Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Chris Dodd D-Conn., AOL Time Warner chairman Steve Case and PBS anchor Jim Lehrer. I don't know anything about captions on pictures, Stringer said. That's not an issue with me or the Japanese executives.
In a broad analysis of the state of U.S. energy markets, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last night disagreed sharply with the Bush administration's argument that capping spot prices for electricity in California would discourage construction of new power plants. Analogies to the economics of office buildings are evident, Greenspan said. Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants. A copy of the text was released in Washington. California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a worrisome situation for Californians, certainly, Greenspan said. And because the state comprises one-eighth of our national economy, it should be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date. Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment. As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices of the things they sell, he said.
First Union Corp., responding to an attack by SunTrust Banks Inc., denied that the use of a tax shelter might force First Union to add to its level of reserves, a move that would decrease future earnings. In a statement Tuesday, First Union said SunTrust had issued false and irresponsible allegations. It continued, We are disgusted. The two banks are fighting to buy Wachovia Corp., a Winston-Salem, N.C., bank with valuable Southeast market share. First Union made a 14.35 billion friendly bid for Wachovia in mid-April. SunTrust, which sought a merger with Wachovia in December only to be rebuffed, responded to First Union's offer in May with a 14.65 billion hostile bid. First Union, Charlotte, N.C., and SunTrust, Atlanta, have traded barbs since. SunTrust on Monday upped the ante in a letter to the Federal Reserve System, alleging that First Union used a controversial tax vehicle to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes. SunTrust's letter left some analysts and investors surprised at the extent to which SunTrust, once considered a genteel Southern bank, went to discredit First Union. It is certainly very close to, if not over the line, said Harold Schroeder, who follows financial-institution stocks for hedge fund Carlson Capital in Dallas. At this point, it's starting to look like a desperation move.
NEW YORK -- Earlier this year, rising energy prices cast a shadow over global bonds. Now, slipping energy costs are brightening prospects for longer maturities, which are the most susceptible to inflation concerns. European Government Bonds may be the chief beneficiary of this shift. The specter of rising inflation fueled by higher energy prices loomed in mid-May, when gasoline futures spiked and crude oil was trading near 29 per barrel. But that worry is now off the agenda, says Mike Ryan, chief fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber in New York. Global bond markets are not overly concerned right now about inflation, he says. Against this backdrop, global inflation concerns have been exaggerated, and inflation should fall in many areas of the world by next year in delayed response to slower growth and declining factory-utilization rates, Deutsche Bank strategists expect. For all major yield curves, this scenario offers positive inflation news, says Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the euro zone, for instance, inflation is expected to fall to 1.8 in 2002 from 2.7 this year, Deutsche Bank estimates. Declines in global energy prices will certainly be welcome at the European Central Bank and should give the ECB more elbow room to cut interest rates, says Cary Leahey, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
On Friday the Labor Department released employment data for June. The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5 and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs. The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates. But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a bias adjustment factor that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires. The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998. Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months. Now we're talking big numbers.
NEW YORK -- DoubleClick Inc. reported a widened second-quarter loss as it struggles with a prolonged slowdown in Internet advertising. DoubleClick, which handles online advertising for other companies, reported a net loss of 37.9 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with 22.1 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20 to 101.9 million from the year-earlier's 128.1 million. The results are far from the company's confident stance augured as late as January, when DoubleClick officials predicted a profit of seven cents to nine cents a share for the year. Four months later, officials reversed their prediction, saying the company wouldn't be profitable in 2001, blaming the economic slowdown across the Internet sector. In a conference call after the close of markets, DoubleClick Chief Executive Officer Kevin Ryan said, We don't see any indication that ad revenue is going to pick up in the third quarter. DoubleClick said that after excluding eight different items, including amortization of intangibles, certain noncash compensation, a write-down of investments and a gain on issuance of DoubleClick Japan stock, its per-share loss would have been seven cents. This was in line with its guidance to investors in April, when it projected a loss after certain items of between five cents and seven cents a share on revenue of 100 million to 105 million. Despite its continuing losses, DoubleClick reported a strong cash position of 812.8 million, though down from 831.5 million at the beginning of the quarter.
American politics has undergone a revolution in its view of public finance. Thirty years ago, a Republican president said, We are all Keynesians now. Economic textbooks of that time discussed the automatic fiscal drag of a progressive income tax, and the need for a continuous fiscal stimulus to offset it. Today, a full year into an economic slowdown, there is virtually unanimous political agreement on the need to maintain a federal surplus of at least 160 billion. Some politicians even argue that this sum is insufficient, that a surplus in excess of 190 billion -- 9 of federal revenue -- is needed. One senator, Kent Conrad D., N.D., took to the Senate floor to announce that risking a surplus of a mere 160 billion, the second largest in American history, was an indication that we were driving right into the fiscal ditch. Sen. Fritz Hollings D., S.C. introduced legislation to repeal the first year of the recently enacted tax cut, arguing that the foregone revenue was needed for other purposes in Washington. By contrast, 38 years ago, President Kennedy proposed a tax cut twice as big a share of gross domestic product as the one just passed. The government was running a budget deficit of 1.3 of GDP at the time, not a huge surplus as today. Saying, in his 1963 State of the Union address, that enacting the tax cut overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress, Kennedy argued that the tax cut will increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises . . . encourage the initiative and risk taking on which our free system depends, induce more investments, production, and capacity use . . . and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for additional effort. Today, by contrast, with a surplus of 1.5 of GDP, Democratic senators warn of driving into a fiscal ditch and seek to recapture the 600 tax-cut checks that American families are about to receive. It is hard to imagine a more extraordinary turn of political perspective.
Dutch supermarket group Ahold NV said it would acquire the remaining shares of Chicago-based online grocer Peapod Inc. that it doesn't already own for about 35 million. The deal comes on the heels of a string of closures from other online grocers, including the high-profile Webvan Group Inc., which shut down its operations earlier this month. But analysts drew a distinction between the likes of Webvan, which wasn't affiliated with an existing, traditional supermarket, and Peapod, which works with Ahold's supermarket chains in the U.S., including Stop & Shop and Giant Food Inc. Ahold, which already owns 58 of Peapod, said it had agreed to buy the company's remaining 17.9 million shares outstanding for 2.15 a share, a 72 premium over Peapod's 4 p.m. Friday price of 1.25. At 4 p.m. yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Peapod was up 69, or 86 cents, to 2.11. Peapod will be delisted from Nasdaq upon completion of the deal, which is expected to happen in the third quarter of this year. Another European retailer to take a stake in the U.S. online grocery market is British supermarket retailer Tesco PLC, which in June bought a 35 stake in GroceryWorks.com, an online grocer established by Safeway Inc. in Pleasanton, Calif. Once a competitive sector, the U.S. online grocery business has thinned out, with Peapod one of the only players left. Closely held HomeRuns.com also closed last week. Without competition in its local markets, Peapod will be relatively free to pursue its own advertising and promotional plans, without concerns that its prices could be undercut, analysts said.
Affiliated Computer Services Inc., attempting to capitalize on the outsourcing of services by state and local governments, agreed to acquire Lockheed Martin Corp.'s IMS subsidiary for 825 million, company executives said. Both boards have approved the transaction, which is expected to be announced this morning. The deal is the largest acquisition by ACS, a Dallas company with 2 billion in revenue and 21,000 employees that was founded in 1988 and has become a leader in business-process outsourcing, handling back-office operations from processing health-insurance claims to loan and mortgage transactions. The sale is expected to generate as much as 550 million for Lockheed, Bethesda, Md. IMS, with 4,800 employees, gets its roughly 580 million in annual revenue by performing a number of tasks for municipal and state government agencies, including administering welfare benefits, tracking down deadbeat dads and snaring red-light runners with strategically placed cameras. The unit is best known for operating E-Zpass, the electronic toll-collection service used by vehicles in the Northeast. The acquisition bolsters ACS's position vying for government contracts against International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., and Electronic Data Systems Corp. of Plano, Texas. ACS gets about one-third of its revenue from the federal government but has been less competitive on state and local government work.
As School Holidays End, The Tax Holidays Begin Retailers are hoping state sales-tax holidays will attract droves of customers into stores for back-to-school shopping even though spending is expected to be down slightly nationwide. Office Depot Inc., Delray Beach, Fla., is disseminating tax holiday fliers in its 85 retail stores in Florida, touting the state-mandated nine-day break from the 6 sales tax that began on Saturday. The South Carolina Merchants Association anticipates more than a 200 million boost in sales, believing customers will flood stores beginning Friday for the latest in a series of weeklong breaks from that state's 5 sales levy. Governors and lawmakers pushing sales-tax holidays argue the overall economic stimulus will offset any lost revenue as people turn out to buy exempt as well as nonexempt items. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates more than a half-dozen states -- including Connecticut, Iowa and Texas -- offer sales-tax breaks for school supplies and clothing. Pennsylvania is offering a weeklong sales-tax holiday for computer purchases only, beginning Sunday. For retailers, every little bit may help Parents and teenagers are expected to spend only an average of 527 on clothing and school supplies, down 4 from last year, according to the American Express Co. retail index.
Michael Hill, manager of the Pilot House Restaurant and Marina in Woodbridge, is crying the blues this summer -- he has had fewer customers than usual all year. During the peak months of April, May and June, only about 40 people showed up each night. He's used to seeing 60. And those who went to the restaurant spent less money, ordered meals that cost less or split a plate. On busy weekend nights, the wait for a table is down to 20 minutes last summer, it was an hour or more. In Manassas, Dominion Semiconductor is unphased by the slowing national economy. Dominion, one of the largest companies in the area, has never stopped hiring and business is steady, said spokesman Mark Holcomb. The company's business plan includes hiring hundreds of people by 2002. We have done nothing to scale back operations based upon a slowdown in the local economy, Holcomb said. I don't think there is much evidence of a slowdown here. Those cases in Prince William County reflect the friction between the local and national economy. Prince William has followed the national economy in some areas but bucks the trend in others.
Linking workers' rights to international trade is an idea whose time has come and stayed, despite the best efforts of free trade ideologues to chase it away. In looming congressional debates about fast track negotiating authority, the Bush administration and Congress confront powerful demands from workers, trade unionists and a wider public for rules protecting human rights and labor rights, not just corporate investments, in trade agreements. That's protectionism is a stock reply of government officials, international economists, multinational executives and many pundits trying to make a labor rights-trade link go away. Instead of engaging critics on the merits, their one-dimensional argument goes like this 1 Expanded trade spurs investment, growth and wealth creation in developing countries 2 after they can afford it, developing countries and companies operating in them will stop violating workers' rights and share the wealth. The first proposition is plausible, leaving aside debates about long-term vs. speculative investment and sustainable vs. destructive growth. But the conclusion does not follow. After wealth has been created, respecting workers' rights and paying them fairly is still a choice, one that doesn't always depend on economics. Instead, choosing justice for workers is driven by organizing, bargaining and political action, increasingly on an international scale. In Sri Lanka a few weeks ago, I met dozens of young women from factories in that country's fast-growing free trade zones who explained that the government's Board of Investment sets up company- controlled worker councils and gets rid of workers who try to form real unions. China's economy has grown impressively in recent years, but workers attempting to form independent unions there are dismissed, harassed and jailed. The rate of fatal factory fires keeps pace with the booming apparel export sectors of Bangladesh and Thailand. When Malaysia tried to pass a law allowing independent union formation in its burgeoning electronics sector, U.S.-based multinationals mounted a collective threat to decamp for Indonesia unless the law was reversed. They got their way.
DUISBURG, Germany -- In Germany's much-vaunted stock exchange known as the Neuer Markt, Sudhir Bhatia is the king of would-be takeovers. Since the beginning of the year, he has jolted three companies' stocks higher by announcing bids to buy them. He faxes out his plans to, he says, 600 media organizations, earning himself prominent attention as a serious player in the newly minted stock market. But look a little closer and Mr. Bhatia's ventures appear quixotic. His company, Microboss Software AG, is tiny, with sales of 1.3 million last year. His takeover announcements often resemble rambling dissertations. He has misspelled his company's name as Micorboss and compared himself to a misunderstood genius. None of the announced bids have been consummated. Welcome to the other side of the Neuer Markt, the centerpiece of Germany's effort to build a U.S.-style stock culture. During the past four years, the Neuer Markt has brought 349 companies public, spurring hopes that Europe had a budding rival to America's Nasdaq Stock Market. But slumping stock prices have laid bare the exchange's flaws. More than half of its biggest companies lost money last year. Smaller companies are filing for insolvency at a record pace. The shares of about 10 of the companies listed now trade for pennies apiece, making the exchange a haven for speculators and market manipulators, critics say.
Ralph Altman, 86, who helped draft and implement national unemployment benefits legislation during 35 years at the Labor Department, died Aug. 1 at Holy Cross Hospital. He was being treated for complications of hip surgery at the Fox Chase Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Silver Spring. Mr. Altman, who lived in Arlington, retired in 1976 as deputy administrator of the Unemployment Insurance Service. He had also been an appeals analyst and chief of appeals and interpretations. He worked at the Federal Farm Labor Service at the Agriculture Department on loan from his agency. He wrote a definitive work on unemployment benefits, Availability for Work, that was published by Harvard University Press. Mr. Altman was a graduate of the State University of New York in his native Albany, where he received a law degree. He did graduate work in labor law at Harvard University. He served in the Navy during World War II.
Government figures released yesterday provided potent ammunition for those who believe the U.S. economy has entered a new era in which technology and a more flexible labor market are making American companies more productive than before. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that productivity -- which measures output per hour worked -- grew at an unexpectedly strong 2.5 percent rate in the second quarter, compared with a revised 0.1 percent rate in the previous quarter. In large part, the improved efficiency in the April-June period resulted from companies' laying off workers and cutting work hours to bring labor costs into line with sluggish demand for their goods. But companies were able to increase overall national production slightly even with reduced workforces -- and the higher productivity figure didn't fit the usual pattern for recessions and slowdowns, when productivity typically begins to fall. Furthermore, revised figures for 1998 through 2000 showed that productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent during that period. That is a bit lower than the 3.2 percent annual rate originally estimated, but it is still well above the pace recorded during most of the 1970s, '80s and early '90s. And it is robust enough to ease the concerns, voiced by some new-economy skeptics, that the productivity gains of recent years were illusory. If you believed before that there was some fundamental change in the way the economy functions, you should believe it still, said Neal Soss, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
The failure of the White House to promote an aggressive economic recovery plan may severely imperil GOP chances of holding on to the House and taking back control of the Senate in 2002. As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government. A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections. Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers the Medicare prescription drug benefit which could cost taxpayers 300 billion over the next 10 years the farm bill which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry and the appropriations bills that could allow spending to grow by 8 or 9 this year. President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers. This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented 4 to 5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least. We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50 so far this year and the IPO market is moribund. Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not Where is the economic and political contingency plan A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging.
NEW YORK -- Coffee futures on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange charged higher Friday in a rally fueled by speculative buying. The most active December contract tacked on 9.5 to end five cents up at 57.85 cents a pound after a shopping spree the coffee pit hadn't seen since late April. Coffee futures have been in an overwhelmingly bearish trend since peaking at 3.18 a pound in May 1997. In the nearer-term, coffee drifted below what is considered as an average cost of production -- 80 cents -- in October 2000 and hasn't looked back. The break to the upside came at the bulls' insistence, as they pushed the market with an eye on speculators' preplaced buy-orders above 54 cents for December futures, and 50.5 cents on the September contract. Once those levels were pierced, the buying wave came with a vengeance. Buy-stops were abundant and ripe, and their triggering fueled the rally that absorbed all the producers' selling around.
NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak. A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed 4.73, or 13, to 33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq. The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5 from 3.75, marking the central bank's seventh rate cut this year. Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed's decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4 during the short term, given the recent technical patterns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4 drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12.
Stocks fell sharply after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, as investors focused on a Fed statement suggesting that the economy will continue to be weak. After trading higher for most of the day, market indexes began falling almost immediately after the Fed announcement. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.66, or 50.05 points, to 1831.30, its lowest level since March 29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.41, or 145.93 points, to 10174.14, its worst level since April 16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.21, or 14.15 points, to 1157.26. Bonds rose and the dollar fell. The stock-market drops, which came even though the Fed's move was in line with Wall Street expectations, reflect a frustration among investors that the current economic slump may be nowhere near a turnaround. It was the most bearish commentary the market could have received, the worst-case scenario, said Bill Schneider, head of stock trading at UBS Warburg. The market has been grasping at straws for evidence of a recovery, but the Fed was blunt and pessimistic.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys, particularly short maturities, rallied after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, as expected. The two-year-note yield -- which moves inversely to its price -- fell to about 3.63, the lowest level since the Treasury began issuing the maturity in 1972. Because policy makers appeared to leave open the possibility of further easing, Treasurys could continue to rally, even after strong gains recently, analysts said. The Treasurys market will return to economic fundamentals and focus on falling business profits and the effects of global weakness, pushing yields downward, said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer in New York. At 4 p.m. Eastern time, the benchmark 10-year note was up 1132 point, or 3.44 per 1,000 face value, at 101 432. Its yield fell to 4.856 from 4.900 late Monday.
YOU CAN ALMOST feel sorry for Microsoft Corp. Last year, when the company was looking like the techno-has-been of the Internet age, its antitrust problems seemed to be fading. But now, with the upstarts put down -- and with interesting new products on the horizon -- Microsoft's business prospects have been revived. So, too, have its antitrust woes. Antitrust scrutiny seems to be an inevitable byproduct of success. I suspect that as long as we keep doing a good job, the level of interest in our business will not go away from competitors nor from appropriate government authorities, complains Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Much of Microsoft's problem is of its own making. The company's exclusionary contracts and other competitive practices were custom-made to attract the scrutiny of antitrust cops. But much, too, may be an inevitable outgrowth of the kind of business Microsoft is in. It's increasingly clear that products whose primary value lies in intellectual property -- products such as software, pharmaceuticals, movies, records and many of the other things that drive today's economy -- are fundamentally different from staples of the industrial economy such as autos and steel, or service-economy products such as banking and insurance. And those fundamental differences are wreaking havoc with traditional notions of economics that underlie antitrust laws, patent laws, copyright laws and indeed, the whole public policy underpinnings of today's economy. Businessmen, economists and policymakers are struggling with the profound implications of those differences. Mr. Gates took a stab at describing them in a speech he gave during his CEO summit in May.
LOOKING INTO the stands at their racetracks, horse-racing executives see two things that bother them thinning crowds and thinning hair. They are counting on the Internet to remedy both. The sport's total handle -- the amount bettors wagered -- was about 14.2 billion last year, up from 8.3 billion a decade earlier. But competition from casinos and an aging fan base have slowed horse racing's growth in the past two years, and the industry is scrambling to put the sport online in hopes of attracting a young and growing Web-savvy market. In the past few years, track owners, gambling companies and entrepreneurs have launched a half-dozen major horse-racing Web sites. With names like YouBet.com, eBetUSA.com and WinTicket.com, the sites offer the chance to wager on races at dozens of tracks around the country and watch the races via live video feeds. Some feature prerace commentary from professional handicappers and, for an extra fee, more sophisticated betting advice. The heyday of horse racing was in the 1950s since then, the industry periodically has had to find new ways to lure fans and bettors. Off-track betting, on-track simulcasting of races from other venues, and telephone betting all have met with some success. But racing executives have even higher hopes for the Internet.
TORONTO -- Facing an industry slowdown, Canadian laser eye-surgery provider TLC Laser Eye Centers Inc. agreed to acquire rival Laser Vision Centers Inc., St. Louis, for 98.7 million in stock, creating North America's biggest operator of laser eye-surgery clinics. The deal brings together TLC's strength in urban centers with Laser Vision's share of the market in smaller towns and rural areas of the U.S., said TLC Chairman and Chief Executive Elias Vamvakas. The combination also will create about 10 million a year in cost savings and growth opportunities, said John J. Klobnak, Laser Vision's chairman and CEO. The industry has seen a slowdown, and the street has been begging for consolidation in this industry, Mr. Klobnak said. Laser Vision has taken a step toward consolidation by agreeing to acquire closely held ClearVision Laser Centers, Lakewood, Colo., earlier this month for an amount that wasn't disclosed. TLC said it is offering 0.95 of its shares for each Laser Vision share. Shares of Laser Vision jumped 62 cents, or 21, to 3.63 in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while TLC shares fell 33 cents, or 7.6 to 4.01. Both companies' shares trade at a fraction of their historic highs. In 1999, Laser Vision reached 37 a share, while TLC hit 53 a share. Demand soared in the late 1990s for laser treatment to correct astigmatism, nearsightedness and farsightedness, but it has leveled off during the past year. Analysts and industry officials say the economic slowdown has prompted consumers to delay the elective procedure, which is deemed cosmetic and isn't covered by most insurance plans.
Stock prices tumbled for the fourth straight day yesterday amid fears that corporate profits are unlikely to rebound anytime soon and consumer spending may finally be slowing. For the first time since early April, the Dow Jones industrial average closed below the 10,000 mark. Yesterday's 171.32-point drop left the Dow at 9919.58, down more than 500 points for the week. The Nasdaq composite index, which topped 5000 at the height of the high-tech boom, ended the day below 1800 for the first time since April. The index closed at 1791.68, down 51.49. Investor confidence is completely broke, said Thomas Galvin, chief strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. People believe that the economic recovery is going to be later, not sooner, and that is adding downward pressure on stock prices. By day's end, many analysts were predicting that stock prices would fall even further in the coming weeks as the market tests how low stock prices have to go before investors finally think it's safe to become buyers again.
The 2,500 layoffs that ended in July at the Motorola cell phone manufacturing plant are still fresh in the minds of residents of this town of 8,000 just south of the Wisconsin border. Motorola Inc. factory had been here just five years and employed some 5,000 workers. Restaurants like Nick's Cozy Nook -- where daily soup-to-dessert specials cost 4.95 -- filled up with Motorola workers during breakfast and dinner breaks. We had so many good years in a row. Everyone knew a downturn was coming, but we really were not ready when it got here, he said. There were a lot of couples who had just bought a house, or couples that had just got married or had children. With the latest figures showing an unexpected surge in the nation's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, there is anxiety throughout the American heartland that the good times are indeed coming to an end. The downturn goes beyond stock market losses and the dot-com crash, worrying manufacturing workers across the country. It's a very nervous feeling out there these days, said Margaret Blackshere, president of the Illinois State Federation of the AFL- CIO. The security of the industrial sector is long gone. Even with the boom in the building sector, they are all nervous. They're wondering, 'Can we plan' and 'Am I going to have a job next week' 
WASHINGTON -- Moving to bolster confidence even before the stock market opened, the Federal Reserve cut its target for short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point and promised to continue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets, as needed, until more normal market functioning is restored. The Fed's move was followed by the European Central Bank as well as the Canadian and Swiss central banks, but not by the Bank of England. Following the terrorist attacks on the U.S., the ECB said, using blunter language than the Fed, uncertainty about the U.S. and the world economy has increased. The Fed left the door open to further rate cuts, emphasizing the weakness that had been seen in employment, production and business spending even before last Tuesday's terror, and the economic risks ahead. The size and timing of the central bank's next move depends on the course taken by the economy and financial markets in the coming weeks. Any projections about what the economy and the Fed will do in coming months need to be taken as even more tentative than usual, economists at UBS Warburg said, even as they predicted a one-quarter-point interest-rate cut at the Fed's Oct. 2 meeting and another of the same size in November.
The market didn't crash. The 684-point fall doesn't even make history's top 10 percentage declines. And so we may conclude that if Congress now does the right thing quickly on tax policy, the market will rise. Problem is, the early indications we're getting is that Congress may enact a new tax bill using conventional means, such as tax credits, mainly to shore up the largest corporations. Incentives at the margin will be minimal. That is, half a loaf. The outlook would be considerably more worrisome had the market's indices spent the whole of yesterday in a steady, precipitous decline. The reality is that most of the day's 7.13 loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day. A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial. The economy before last week was already in the doldrums, with little upside evident so far from a series of interest rate cuts, or for that matter the tax rebate. Much of the airline industry has suffered for years from fixed union costs that leave little room for sustained profitability. The closure of the air transport system may have merely pitched several airlines toward inevitable dissolution, which would be reflected in yesterday's trading. That said, share prices generally rose in Europe, and Asia's losses were modest. It is a small miracle that trading in New York opened at all most likely operations will smooth in the weeks and months ahead. Most importantly, all available evidence suggests that the men and women who make up the American economy are prepared to move heaven and earth to prove that their system will not be defeated by homicidal barbarism.
ECONOMIC RIPPLES from last week's terrorist attacks are being felt in all regions of the U.S. But the force of the impact will depend very much on where you live. Among the hardest hit will be states and cities built on tourism, including Florida and Las Vegas. They were holding up best amid a slumping economy before the attacks. But now that air travel has been hobbled by security fears, sharply reduced visits by vacationers and business travelers have dimmed those economic bright spots. A few regions may weather the storm better oil-producing economies such as Houston and Louisiana defense-contracting strongholds such as Southern California and northern Virginia and areas where displaced Manhattan firms are setting up temporary or permanent offices, most notably New Jersey, which could gain as many as 100,000 jobs. Still, few places, if any, will escape unscathed. There is no part of the country whose outlook has not worsened, says Mark Vitner, economist for First Union Securities in Charlotte, N.C. The impact of the attacks will whack from one to more than three percentage points off anticipated growth in output over the next nine months, depending on the region and whether the expected U.S. military response is relatively quickly resolved or protracted and uncertain. Overall, the U.S. gross national product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- would grow only 1.5 between the second quarters of 2001 and 2002 under the more optimistic scenario and contract 0.05 under the more pessimistic assumption, according to Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., economic-consulting firm. That compares with a pre-attack forecast of 2.55 growth.
They started lining up before dawn Monday outside the unemployment office in Alexandria, and it hasn't let up. Most had worked at hotels, at companies that refuel or make meals for airplanes, or in restaurants at the shut-down Reagan National Airport. The agency has had to borrow vacant office space to handle the crowds -- the biggest since the early 1990s, said Nancy Dean, who manages the city's branch of the Virginia Employment Commission. We're just trying to keep them moving through here, she said. Aftershocks of last week's terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and in New York are being felt in every part of the local economy. One expert said a third of the area's 150,000 hospitality jobs are at risk, as the closed airport and the security measures in downtown Washington keep tourists and business travelers away. US Airways' plan to lay off thousands of workers will contribute to what economists expect to be the first large jump in the region's unemployment rate in years. Business leaders worry that there will be longer-term ramifications if Washington, once considered one of the dynamic markets in the country, is now seen as a viable target for terrorism.
Corrections & Amplifications THE BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS survey last week didn't cover the unemployment rate. A page-one article Friday, which said that the scenario painted by the Blue Chip forecasts would send the jobless rate toward 7, incorrectly implied that the survey covered the unemployment rate. WSJ Sept. 24, 2001 Unable to fly home from a management huddle in Lake Tahoe, Nev., last week, a dozen executives of Park Place Entertainment Corp. commandeered one of the resort company's shuttle buses and drove to Las Vegas, with Chief Executive Tom Gallagher behind the wheel for much of the 500-mile trip. Along the way, the executives made a critical decision They shelved plans for a new 450 million, 900-suite luxury hotel tower for Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a move announced publicly this week. The thought was, let's keep our powder dry a little longer, says Mr. Gallagher. The next few months are going to be rugged. The nation's economy, already stalling prior to Sept. 11, is heading into recession. The consensus of forecasters surveyed Wednesday by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is that the recession will last through the end of this year. What happens then is in dispute. Three-quarters of the forecasters think the recession will be no worse than the mild 1990-91 downturn a quarter think it will be worse.
Investing in stocks can be risky, sometimes very risky. While that may seem obvious after the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst weekly percentage loss in 61 years, of 14.25 and its worst-ever weekly point loss, 1,369.70 points, it wasn't something that many investors probably spent enough time thinking about during the bull market run of the 1990s. Now, with the Bush administration warning of a lengthy battle against terrorism, investors say that the risks associated with owning stocks -- as opposed to safer securities with more predictable returns, such as bonds -- are poised to rise. This is what analysts call a risk premium as it gets higher, investors require a greater return from stocks compared to bonds. For most analysts, it is not a question of whether stocks are riskier today than they have been for years. Rather, they are asking how much riskier And for how long will this period of heightened risk continue I am worried this crisis is going to be systemic in the sense that, at least for a while, it has changed the world, Barton Biggs, global equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report following the terrorist attack. The risk premium for equities -- and maybe for all long-term assets -- is going to rise.
The day after the World Trade Center was destroyed by terrorists, White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey received a call from the chief executive of a major airline. The carrier's credit line was being yanked by a financial institution. Lindsey is a fervent believer in free markets and market-driven solutions. But with airplanes grounded and the U.S. stock markets closed after the Sept. 11 attacks, he and other members of President Bush's economic team chose government intervention instead of a laissez-faire approach. Lindsey called the head of the financial institution. This is an issue of national importance, he told the banker. You might want to think of the broader picture. He argued that this was only a temporary jam for the carrier and suggested that Congress would likely do something to assist the industry. Lindsey put down the receiver. He didn't want to find out what happened to the credit line. There were limits to bending the rules of the free market. The Bush economic team tested those limits in the first week after the attacks. Interviews with sources familiar with the events show that key members of the team involved themselves in details large and small in an effort to keep the economy from seizing up, even going so far as to urge Americans to buy stocks. What follows is an account of that first week -- from the day of the attacks until the next Monday, when the stock market reopened -- six days when the economic team focused not on the economy's long-term fundamentals but rather on the operational emergencies of the moment.
HONG KONG -- If the time to buy is when nobody else likes a particular sector, this is the week to snap up shares in Hong Kong residential real-estate developers. Then again, all of those people bidding down the stocks are probably right to sell, at least if they want to make a profit in the next year or so. This is a sector with problems Most of the tycoons who own the companies have yet to weigh in with anything positive, such as share purchases, and real-estate prices in Hong Kong remain stuck about 50 below their 1997 peaks. Prices had looked as if they were bottoming out two weeks ago. But then came the terrorist attacks in the U.S., which analyst Andrew Lawrence at Deutsche Bank says knocked 5 to 10 off prices of used apartments. So, while Hong Kong property may still be expensive by world standards, by the city's measure it is going cheap. Gloom emanates from the city's boardrooms. This was Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hang Lung Group, reporting results Monday for one of the few stocks in the sector analysts seem to like In view of the very weak market with much uncertainty, land acquisition must be done with extreme caution. Prices, profit margins and transaction volumes are all falling and will likely stay low for the foreseeable future.
SAN JOSE, Calif. AP -- Burned by the dot-com blowout and costly growth investments, Web-hosting concern Exodus Communications Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, but said its business will continue to operate. Exodus, a Santa Clara, Calif., provider of services to major sites including Yahoo and eBay, has warned for months that it was quickly running out of cash and needed additional financing to stay afloat. In addition to the Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., Exodus said it received a commitment for up to 200 million in debtor-in-possession financing from General Electric Co.'s GE Capital. We will now be able to devote efforts to solidifying and executing on a go-forward operating plan that is based on tough-minded fiscal discipline and focuses on managing Exodus to profitability, said L. William Krause, Exodus' chief executive. It wasn't immediately clear whether the filing would lead to customer defections. Yahoo Inc. officials were looking into the situation, spokeswoman Shannon Stubo said. EBay Inc. didn't return a telephone message.
WASHINGTON -- President Bush was up around 530 a.m. as usual on Tuesday, the two-week anniversary of the terrorist attacks. He walked his dogs Barney and Spot, thumbed through the morning papers and -- unwilling to wait an hour for breakfast with congressional leaders -- ate a bowl of cereal. Even in the tumult of these times, it is a point of pride for this control-conscious president to maintain an ordinary schedule early to bed, early to rise. But as the rest of his day shows, the president and his presidency have been forever changed. The president often appears more serious, more stern and more conscious of the image he projects, here and abroad, according to lawmakers and aides who have spent time with him. A unilateralist for much of his first eight months in office, he has found himself relying on numerous foreign leaders, phoning them from the Oval Office in the morning, and from his residence after sundown. Remarkably, for a man who came to office unschooled in foreign affairs and with scant experience abroad, Mr. Bush has embraced the foreign-policy imperative and, aides say, shows far less interest in the domestic matters that had preoccupied him up to now. He has winnowed his agenda to bipartisan-only legislation. In the conduct of domestic and international affairs, he has formed the kind of alliance with Democrats in Congress that he talked about in his 2000 campaign, but hadn't forged in office. The terrorist attacks impacted him personally and impacted his agenda, says Dan Bartlett, a top aide. His days have changed.
Most days, Maria Salientes works the gates and ramps for US Airways Express at Reagan National Airport. Today, she is sitting at home with her three children, out of work and unsure whether she can return to the only U.S. airport that remains closed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Salientes, 29, is but one face of about 10,000 National Airport workers whose lives have been turned upside down by the Bush administration's decision to close indefinitely an airport that is an anchor of the region's economy. About 45,000 people a day used National. Until federal officials determine whether to reopen it, workers such as Salientes are in turmoil, trying to figure out their next step. US Airways Express, a network of 10 airlines that ferry US Airways passengers between hubs and cities, retains 150 people at National. Of those, 120 -- including Salientes -- are collecting unemployment. I want to get my employees back, said Salientes's boss, Daryush Mazhari, the US Airways Express station manager at National. These were tragic incidents, and we understand. But you can't safeguard against everything all the time. The planes didn't come from National.

If Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has his way, the nation's schoolchildren will soon be adding monetary policy to their courses on reading, writing and arithmetic. The Fed yesterday unveiled a new Web site, www.federalreserveeducation.org, which is designed to teach how the central bank affects the economy through its conduct of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has actively promoted economic education and better public understanding of the roles of the Federal Reserve for many years, Greenspan said in a statement announcing the new site. This Web site is intended to improve the information resources available to educators, students and others with an interest in the Federal Reserve and how it works, Greenspan said. The site was to supplement high school and college economics and social studies classes. But Fed officials said it was also created with the hope that its format will be accessible for students of all ages.
The Freedom Forum, the Arlington-based media foundation that operates the Newseum, announced yesterday that it is scrapping its international division, closing five offices and significantly reducing staff following stock market losses that have eaten away about 30 percent of the foundation's endowment in the last two years. Charles L. Overby, chairman and chief executive of the Freedom Forum, said in a statement that the market downturn, which has cost the foundation 300 million, forced it to choose which priorities we will emphasize over the next several years. In 2000, the Freedom Forum paid 100 million to the D.C. government for a property on Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street NW. It plans to construct a building for foundation offices and the Newseum, a journalism history and current events museum now located near the Freedom Forum's Rosslyn headquarters. The project also includes a restaurant, retail space and condominiums. The foundation is planning to move to its new D.C. site in 2005. The Freedom Forum will conduct a major reorganization this fall, designed to look ahead to our move to Pennsylvania Avenue, the statement said. This reorganization signals the beginning of the transition to our new facility.
QWhile refinancing our home, I saw that mortgage interest rates were declining. I called my potential lender and we agreed that I would let the interest rate float rather than lock it in. My loan officer advised me that rates were not down at his company. When I told him that I was offered a lower rate when I called the financial institution's toll-free number, the loan officer just shrugged this off, saying, That was probably just to draw new business. I was told that I could not get a lower rate because I was already in the system. Is this usual or ethical AWe either have the classic situation of bait and switch, or your loan officer was just trying to make you keep a higher mortgage rate. However, your question has confused me. If your loan was not locked in, that is, you were to obtain a floating rate, then why did the loan officer indicate that you were already in the system, supposedly at a certain rate Let's look at the basic difference between a floating rate and a locked-in rate. Take your chances that when you actually go to closing, the then- current mortgage interest rate will be equal to or less than the rate at the time you made the loan application. Lock in the rate so that whether rates go up or down, you are guaranteed to get the rate you have agreed upon. The first choice is often referred to as a floating rate the second is a lock-in rate.
Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending. The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon -- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing. Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils losses in the time value of money a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear. If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages.
THE BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS survey didn't include a forecast on the U.S. unemployment rate. An article on job uncertainty in Monday's edition incorrectly said the survey forecast that the U.S. unemployment rate would approach 7. See Economy Jobs Become Scarce In Areas That Rely On Travel, Tourism -- WSJ Oct. 1, 2001 --- HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL Inc. has announced 7,600 layoffs since Sept. 11.

The Federal Reserve, delivering the lowest short-term rates since John F. Kennedy was president, is pursuing its most aggressive campaign in recent history to stimulate the economy. But it's a campaign whose goal seems more elusive with each passing day. Yesterday, the Fed cut the target for its benchmark federal-funds interest rate to 2.5 from 3, and left the door open to further rate cuts. The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak, the Fed said in a statement explaining its action. Though the Fed's move was widely anticipated, investors reacted positively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 113.76 points, 1.29, to 8950.59. Including its emergency rate cut just before the nation's stock markets reopened on Sept. 17, the Fed has chopped U.S. rates a full percentage point since Sept. 11, and by a whopping four percentage points since the start of the year. But lower interest rates work only if they induce consumers and businesses to borrow -- and then spend -- more. And since the Fed began cutting rates, the growth in business borrowing has ground to a halt, and consumer-credit growth has slowed sharply. Only home mortgage lending is still growing at a healthy pace, and even that has taken a hit in the wake of the terrorist attack.
Correction An editorial page article, The Agony of the Left Oct. 4, incorrectly stated where a Salman Rushdie article had appeared. It ran in the Washington Post, not the New York Times. WSJ Oct. 16, 2001 One of the most telling things I have seen since the Sept. 11 massacre was an early peace movement e-mail. It listed three major demands stop the war stop racism stop ethnic scapegoating. A liberal friend had appended a sardonic comment to the bottom. Any chance we could come out against terrorism as well One of the overlooked aspects of the war we are now fighting is the awakening it has spawned on the left. In one atrocity, Osama bin Laden may have accomplished what a generation of conservative writers have failed to do convince mainstream liberals of the illogic and nihilism of the powerful postmodern left. For the first time in a very long while, many liberals are reassessing -- quietly for the most part -- their alliance with the anti-American, anti-capitalist forces they have long appeased, ignored or supported. Of course the initial response of left-wing intellectuals to Sept. 11 was one jerking of the collective knee. This was America's fault. From Susan Sontag to Michael Moore, from Noam Chomsky to Edward Said, there was no question that, however awful the attack on the World Trade Center, it was vital to keep attention fixed on the real culprit the United States. Of the massacre, a Rutgers professor summed up the consensus by informing her students that We should be aware that, whatever its proximate cause, its ultimate cause is the fascism of U.S. foreign policy over the past many decades. Or as a poster at the demonstrations in Washington last weekend put it, Amerika, Get A Clue.
The nation's governors, alarmed by a steep decline in revenues last month, appealed yesterday to Congress and the Bush administration for emergency assistance. Unless help comes soon, they warned, states will have to slash their spending, thereby increasing the risk of a serious recession. Michigan Gov. John Engler R, the chairman of the National Governors Association, told reporters in a conference call from Lansing that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states have seen a double-digit drop in tax receipts compared with a year ago. The governors suggested steps they would like to see included in the stimulus package being drafted on Capitol Hill, with the blessing of the Bush administration. In addition to expanded unemployment, health and other benefits for families of laid-off workers, they asked for relief from some federal regulations and the suspension of state matching requirements on major federal highway, airport and other construction programs. Engler and Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton D, who is vice chairman of the governors association and presented the program to members of Congress yesterday, emphasized that unless help comes soon, balanced- budget requirements in most state constitutions will force program cuts and layoffs, deepening the economic slump.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge starts work next week as the nation's director of homeland security, but some lawmakers question whether he will have the power to get much done. Senior members of the House's new terrorism subcommittee introduced legislation yesterday that would give him authority to reject other agencies' counterterrorism budgets and require his confirmation by the Senate. President Bush named Ridge to his new post in the wake of last month's terrorist attacks. He needs the force of law, more than just the bully pulpit, said Rep. Jane Harman Calif., the subcommittee's ranking Democrat. Rep. Jim Gibbons R-Nev., the subcommittee's vice chairman, said, Without this legislation, Governor Gov. Ridge cannot do the job that President Bush has tasked him to do. Harman said supporters may try to have the legislation considered as part of the broad anti-terrorism package the House is expected to consider next week.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill loves tossing out ideas, some half-baked or even alarming to his foes, just to gauge the reaction. He revels in speaking bluntly, sometimes rattling markets and members of Congress. Wit and sarcasm, along with a little profanity in private, are essential tools in his verbal arsenal. But last week, sitting in his office, which had been recently redecorated in a vivid blue, O'Neill seemed almost wistful as he considered the battering his image has taken in the press. When it's portrayed that you're out of the loop and all that kind of stuff, I think it really does have some impact on your effectiveness, he said. The conventional wisdom in Washington is that O'Neill is some sort of supernova, a spectacular, doomed explosion. The truth is more fascinating and complex -- and also revealing about the Bush White House. Within the Bush administration, O'Neill appears to have not only survived, but thrived. His zest for combative language and his zeal for new ideas has made him a favorite of President Bush, though his style has rankled some officials. The president meets with him privately for a half-hour about once a week, a privilege that President Bill Clinton did not grant his Treasury secretaries for fear it would give them an unfair advantage in interagency discussions. O'Neill is also a key member of the president's war cabinet. The president likes his big thinking, even when it's way out of his realm of responsibility, said a senior White House official directly involved in policymaking. The chemistry between him and the president is very good.
IF THE WORLD HAS changed, maybe your portfolio should, too. In the wake of last month's terrorist attacks and the current U.S. military response, I wouldn't radically revamp your investment mix. Instead, the idea is to tweak your portfolio, cutting back here, adding a little money there, to reflect some of the startling changes of the past 18 months and especially the past four weeks. Consider what has happened. The Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates, hoping to avert a recession but raising the specter of renewed inflation. Stocks have shed 30 of their value, yet remain richly valued. Bonds and money-market funds have fared far better, but today offer paltry yields. What does all this mean for your portfolio As you reassess your investment mix, try these four steps Step 1 Take a Stand
Economic Diversity A Tale of Two Cities Anaheim, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., seem to have a lot in common Both are major tourist destinations thanks to amusement parks -- Disneyland and Disney World, respectively -- owned by Walt Disney Co., Burbank, Calif. So, with tourism tanking following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, why have Anaheim's bonds been placed on Standard & Poor's CreditWatch, with negative implications, and Orlando's have not The answer, according to S&P managing director Colleen Woodell diversity of revenue streams and size of reserves. Being placed on CreditWatch is considered a red flag about changing conditions, and doesn't necessarily lead to changes in credit ratings. But the different treatment of the two cities provides a lesson in fiscal policy. Anaheim's vulnerability comes from its heavy reliance on tourist-dependent revenues, specifically hotel-motel and sales taxes, which make up about 54 of total revenues. In contrast, tourist-sensitive taxes, mainly sales taxes, account for only about 13 of revenues in Orlando, which also has strong collections from property taxes, utility taxes and business fees.
NEW YORK -- The ailing U.S. economy could soon get a much-needed boost from an unexpected source falling energy prices. Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some economists expected oil prices to rise on fears that a war in the Middle East would disrupt the supply of oil. Instead, prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have all fallen as concerns have grown that a possible global recession could drastically cut demand for energy. In the short run, those declines should act like a tax cut for consumers, freeing up funds for additional spending. They should also help cut costs at companies that have big fuel bills, including those in some of the hardest-hit industries, including airlines, trucking companies and manufacturers. In total, the recent declines could produce tens of billions of dollars in savings for companies and individual users of fuel, says Tom Robinson, senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. While that alone won't keep the country out of recession, it certainly will act as a salve in the wounds from the recession we're in, adds Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley.
Mayor Anthony A. Williams petitioned the White House yesterday for 736 million in federal relief -- about five times what officials originally proposed -- to help the District recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and overhaul the city's emergency preparedness system. In addition, the city wants 182 million for grants to protect streets, schools and technology infrastructure, according to a copy of the proposal provided to The Washington Post. In all, the city wants more than 900 million in federal aid. The request submitted late yesterday was far more ambitious than the 150 million in federal assistance aired by Williams D at a D.C. Council hearing Friday. Council members assailed the sum as far too low for a city forced to confront massive costs for the exigencies of 21st-century terrorist threats and economic losses that followed the calamity. The District is asking for 233 million for emergency preparedness and 503 million for economic recovery. Congress is already talking about a major stimulus, already talking about homeland security, the mayor said in an interview. Obviously, the downside of this is that it's a significant amount of money.
The wide-ranging investigation into money-laundering tied to the Sept. 11 attacks has put a big strain on Wall Street legal departments, which have been working overtime to meet demands for trading records and other information. In recent weeks, regulators and investigators have inundated securities firms with requests for customer-account documents and other records they believe are vital to tracking down a money trail that could show how various terrorist groups fund their activities. These records include blue sheets, or trading records, and other types of customer data. The large number of requests has some Wall Street firms up in arms, and could make it more difficult for investigators to track down the money trail leading to terrorist groups. Securities firms grouse that they have received requests for money-trail information from eight or nine different agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers. We're getting the same requests from five different entities, says a lawyer from a major Wall Street firm. So last week, federal officials and Wall Street firms sought to iron out their differences. At a series of meetings -- one at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the other in the New York offices of Prudential Securities, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- investigators agreed to better coordinate their data requests to prevent duplication, and Wall Street firms have pledged their full cooperation in the probe.
WASHINGTON -- The House Ways and Means Committee will introduce its economic-stimulus package tomorrow -- in the form of a blank sheet of paper. The unusual move allows members to offer their pet stimulus proposals by amendment. It also assures that the bill submitted to the full House will be heavily seasoned with Republican priorities, including a capital-gains tax cut and possibly corporate income-tax breaks. Republicans outnumber Democrats on the panel by nearly 2 to 1. The approach, offered by Chairman Bill Thomas R., Calif., is unprecedented in recent memory. Since Republicans took control of the House in 1995, party leaders have tightly controlled Ways and Means, often dictating the parameters of crucial bills. That has repeatedly frustrated Democrats and even Republicans on the panel who, despite their prized assignment, get little chance to push their own priorities. By setting up a free-for-all, Mr. Thomas is allowing conservatives to play a more prominent role in the debate. Their priorities have gotten short shrift in recent negotiations between Congress and the White House. Starting tomorrow, Mr. Thomas said, There's nothing on the table or off the table. We're going to let the committee build the product. He is unclear if House rules would allow him to start from scratch -- Democrats insist he at least needs a bill number and a title -- but if they do, he said, My goal is to bring in a blank piece of paper.
Boston College 20Virginia Tech quarterback Grant Noel thrust both arms over his head with unprecedented enthusiasm after completing a touchdown pass to Andre Davis just more than five minutes into tonight's game. Noel wasn't just celebrating the lead, which No. 6 Virginia Tech promptly turned into a 34-20 win over Boston College. Rather, his jubilance came in response to months of questions -- despite the Hokies' undefeated record -- not only about his productivity but, more pointedly, his ability to throw the deep ball. The 37-yard strike to Davis in the right corner of the end zone on the Hokies' opening drive quieted those concerns and ignited the sold- out crowd of 53,662 at Lane Stadium. It also sent Noel and the rest of the players on the sideline into a frenzy and prompted smiles from the three Rose Bowl representatives who were in attendance at a Virginia Tech game for the first time in school history. That's about as good as it gets, Noel said. It was a great feeling. It was exactly what we needed to set the tempo for the game. Noel added two more throws of 29 and 19 yards on the ensuing drive to move the Hokies 6-0, 3-0 Big East into scoring position, and then ran it in himself from one yard to extend their lead to 14-0 with 7 minutes 56 seconds to play in the opening quarter. That's when Virginia Tech's defense -- which was irritated this week by comments made by several Boston College offensive lineman who all but guaranteed a 100-yard performance by junior tailback William Green -- took over.
Until Friday, Wall Street seemed to be staging its own version of a patriotic rally. After the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, an already battered stock market went into near free fall. At the market's bottom, 10 days later, the Dow Jones industrial average had tumbled more than 14 percent, the Nasdaq had slumped 16 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had dropped nearly 12 percent. But then the market reversed course. By the end of the day Thursday -- one month after the attacks -- both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 had recouped all of their post-Sept. 11 losses. On Friday, the rally took a breather, with most of the major indexes posting modest losses, weighed down by a disappointing report on retail sales and higher-than-expected producer prices. At one point Friday, the Dow plunged 100 points in just a few minutes after the first report of a case of anthrax at NBC News in New York, reaching a loss of more than 200 points. But the Dow clawed its way back late in the day, closing with a loss of just 66 points the Nasdaq actually closed a little higher Friday. The bullish camp theorizes that things have gotten as bad as possible, that there's no place for the market to go but up. The country is, after all, already in a state of war. The economy clearly has fallen into a recession. Earnings will be bad this quarter and next. And the tech sector remains mired in a slump that's now more than a year old. But the markets already have adjusted for all of that. On the other hand, the market likes the fact that the early days of the war have gone without a hitch, with no U.S. combat deaths or injuries. Meanwhile, both Congress and the Federal Reserve have shown a determination to prop up the faltering economy. Following two half- point cuts in the past month, the federal funds rate now stands at 2.5 percent, or slightly less than the inflation rate, and there is no reason to think the Fed is finished slashing. Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. market strategist at Lehman Brothers, figures we could get down to 1.5 percent to 2 percent short-term rates by sometime next year, the lowest level since the late 1950s. At the same time, Congress is brewing up an incentive package of tax cuts and spending programs that should add further fuel to the economic fire. Applegate notes that in every recession since 1950, the market rebounded before the economy did, driven by the combined effects of rate cuts, falling inflation and, in some cases, tax cuts. The key variable for the stock market is how much stimulus does the market think is in the pipeline, he said. And the truth is there's a lot, with more to come.
WASHINGTON -- Consumer sentiment bounced back a bit this month as the nation began to adjust to both the aftereffects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the U.S. air strikes on Afghanistan. The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index rose to 83.4 in mid-October from 81.8 at the end of September and well above the low of 72 recorded in one week late in September. The latest number was close to the 83.6 reading in mid-September. The university's survey showed that consumers are feeling more optimistic about the future, with the index for consumer expectations rising to 77.9 in mid-October from 73.5 at the end of September and 77.2 in mid-September. The latest economic numbers, meanwhile, seemed to tell less about where the country is headed than where it had been after the terrorist attacks. Wholesale prices rose 0.4 in September from August, according to the Labor Department. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales plunged 2.4 last month, which was largely expected because of the terrorist attacks. Everyone was home watching television the week of the 11th, said Bryan Jordan, an economist with Banc One Investment Advisors. If we're looking for a silver lining in these numbers, it's that pipeline pressures continue to be well-behaved, and I think that does signal lower inflation. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee isn't likely to see September's producer prices as a significant factor when it meets next month, Mr. Jordan said. He predicted at least one more round of interest-rate cuts as policy makers continue to try to prod the economy toward recovery.
BERLIN -- When the last recession hit Europe in 1993 in the aftermath of the Gulf War, corporate profits shrank by more than 20 from two years earlier. Now, fears are mounting that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the weakening U.S. economy may tip an already slowing Europe into another recession. Is a similar profit squeeze expected Hardly. The latest earnings consensus forecasts 30 growth from the end of this year through 2003, according to Merrill Lynch. A compilation of estimates done nine days after the attacks expects European profits to grow by 14.6 next year. That actually is up slightly from the August consensus The compilation was done by IBES, a financial-research firm. That comforting outlook could mean one of two things European companies are reasonably well fortified against the worsening economic climate which likely won't turn into a recession and could signal a stock-market rally in the months ahead. Or, it could mean these companies and investors are in for a rude surprise.
Most stocks fell for a second straight day, in what some investors called an overdue pullback. Although the current stock weakness has been sparked by the report of more anthrax exposure, in New York and on Capitol Hill, a more fundamental reason is that stocks have come back sharply since hitting bottom on Sept. 21 and now are consolidating, these investors believe. We think we are in a two-step-forward, one-step-back mode, said John Meara, president of St. Louis money-management firm Argent Capital Management. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average still up 11 since bottoming out on Sept. 21, and with the immediate prospects for the economy and the antiterrorism campaign still uncertain, some investors are taking profits on their recent gains. Although the Nasdaq Composite Index rebounded 0.39, or 6.38 points, to 1652.72 following Wednesday's 4.4 slide, most stocks fell on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The industrials were down 0.76, or 69.75 points, at 9163.22, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.79, or 8.48 points, to 1068.61. Bonds were little changed and the dollar fell.
The U.S. Postal Service is reeling from the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the ongoing anthrax scare, with declining mail use and rising costs threatening the financial viability of the venerable institution, according to analysts. Mail volume was down 5 percent in September over the same period last year. Revenue in the first three weeks after the attacks was as much as 500 million below forecast. Costs associated with damage to a post office near the World Trade Center are at 63 million and mounting. Postal Service officials express faith that the institution will recover, but others say the government-created monopoly is spending money it can ill-afford to increase security, combat the anthrax threat and ensure safe and timely mail delivery. No one knows how much the fear of anthrax-tainted mail will lead to further declines in volume. It's unprecedented, Postal Rate Commission analyst Robert Cohen said. This was a direct attack using the mail as a weapon. It is making everybody rethink the role of the Postal Service. The rate payer will wind up paying a lot more money for this. What's likely to happen is the debt will keep growing and growing, and, ultimately, it could be up to Congress to bail them out. Even before Sept. 11, the Postal Service was expecting a 1.65 billion deficit for fiscal 2001. It had announced it would seek its third rate hike in less than a year. It had cut 21,000 positions. It was 11 billion in debt, fast approaching the 15 billion ceiling set by Congress. It froze most capital projects. Its premier product, Priority Mail, was declining after years of exponential growth.
MARYLAND OFFICIALS were saying proudly a couple of months ago that they expected the state to run a modest surplus in the current fiscal year. Now they're looking at a deficit instead. To begin to ward it off, Gov. Parris Glendening this week ordered more than 200 million in budget cuts, and it's likely there will be more if, as expected, the Sept. 11 attacks accentuate the economic slowdown that was already underway. The same pattern is evident in Virginia, though there, officials struggling to protect the governor's irresponsible car tax repeal have been slower to respond. The state was giddily projecting 7.5 percent revenue growth for the fiscal year. In fact, in the first quarter of the year, from July through September, revenue collections were down 2.4 percent from the year before, and that too was mainly before the September attacks. The District is in a similar bind. The attack on the Pentagon, the temporary closing of Reagan National Airport and the drop-off in tourism have delivered sharp blows to the city's economy. As D.C. chief financial officer Natwar Gandhi announced yesterday, it seems possible that local sources of revenue could be reduced by as much as 90 million to 100 million in fiscal 2002 compared with the fiscal 2002 budget estimate. And there's a good chance the current revenue estimate for fiscal 2003 will also need to be reduced. The District's difficulties are compounded by its debt burden, the second highest in the nation among cities. That heavy load limits the city's borrowing capability. And the city's problem is more basic a long-term structural imbalance between its revenue base and required expenditures, brought on by restrictions on the city's taxing authority. Five years of economic good times masked that imbalance, as Mr. Gandhi said yesterday. With the economy souring, the imbalance will become glaringly apparent, he said. All over the country, state and local governments are having to cut back, or else raise taxes. They have no choice their revenues are down and they are bound by law or tradition to balance their budgets. But the squeeze occurs at precisely the wrong time. By cutting back, the states amplify the downturn that afflicts them, and the amplification is the greater because the cuts come just as more people are qualifying for unemployment benefits, welfare and Medicaid spending goes down when it ought to be going up. This time around, state and local officials, particularly in such areas as this, face sharply increased security costs as well.
WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's index of leading indicators fell 0.5 in September, another sign that the economy could be sliding closer to recession. September's drop followed a revised 0.1 decline in August, a smaller drop than the 0.3 decline initially reported. That followed three monthly increases, which appeared to signal the economy might have stopped slowing. It looked like things were bottoming out and starting to look a little bit bitter, said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Obviously, September has changed that. The drop in the leading index in September is the largest one-month decline since January 1996, said Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board. Without the aggressive expansionary policy being adopted by the Federal Reserve, this drop would have been much deeper, he said. Six out of the 10 indicators fell in September. The largest negative contributors to the index were stock prices and initial claims for unemployment insurance. The most significant positive contributors were money supply and interest rate spreads.
U.S. stocks surged as investors focused on hopes for an economic and corporate upturn, rather than on news of more anthrax exposure in Washington. The major indexes once again finished the day close to their highest points since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. People are kind of adopting a stiff upper lip here, like the British in World War II, said stock trader Michael Driscoll at Credit Suisse First Boston. They are focusing on the future and not looking at the past or the present. People are looking out six to 12 months and thinking that they don't see anything that will get a lot worse. Technology stocks led the gains, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 2.2, or 36.77 points, to 1708.08, just above its close of 1695.38 on Sept. 10, the day before the terrorist attacks. The index is almost back to the Oct. 16 level of 1722.07, the highest mark since last month's attacks. Older industrial stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also put in strong gains, as did bank stocks. The Dow industrials advanced 1.88, or 172.92 points, to 9377.03. That still is more than 200 points below the industrial average's Sept. 10 close of 9605.51, although it is close to the average's highest post-attack close, 9410.45, on Oct. 11.
State transit officials say many Charles County residents have complained about a plan to double the tolls for some motorists using the Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge, but they still defended their decision this week before the county commissioners. On Nov. 1, the toll for a regular two-axle vehicle will jump from 1.50 to 3 when crossing the Potomac River from Charles County on Route 301. The rate for each additional axle will also increase from 1.50 to 3. Commuters will still be able to buy a 15 pass that allows 25 trips through the gates and is valid for 60 days. Tom Osborne, executive secretary of the Maryland Transportation Authority, said the increases are necessary to help fund 4.7 billion in capital improvements included in the authority's 20-year plan. Because the state first decided to increase tolls on Interstate 95 in Baltimore, Osborne said increasing tolls on Route 301 became a necessary byproduct. We felt that we had to address Route 301 or else it could become a bypass corridor for all those seeking to avoid the tolls, Osborne said.
The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped cause the already weakened U.S. economy to contract slightly in the July-September period, the first such decline in more than eight years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Some economists said the decline in the nation's output of goods and services signaled that the U.S. economy has entered its first recession in more than a decade. Others said the outlook remains uncertain. If it's not a recession technically, it really doesn't matter, because growth is so far below the country's potential to grow that unemployment is rising, corporate profits are falling, and business spending on new plants and equipment is plunging, said economist James Glassman of J.P. Morgan Chase Securities. President Bush said the report confirmed that the attacks hurt the U.S. economy, and he appealed to Congress to quickly pass legislation to stimulate economic growth. The attacks affected our workforce and affected our business base, Bush said in a speech to business executives. People are having tough times in America. People are losing their jobs. . . . It's time for our government to act in a positive and constructive way. The Congress needs to pass a stimulus package and get it to my desk before the end of November.
EUROPE Euro-Zone Economy Is in Early Stages Of a Mild Recession A growing number of economists say they believe Europe is in the early stages of a mild recession. Sharp falls in manufacturing activity, business confidence and employment on both sides of the Atlantic since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. have convinced some economists that the euro-zone economy is shrinking slightly this quarter and will continue to do so in the next, meeting the conventional definition of a technical recession, or two quarters of economic contraction. Goldman Sachs slashed its euro-area growth estimate for next year to 0.6 from 1.7, and in a report to clients predicted the economy would shrink at an annual rate of 0.5 to 1 this quarter and next. Citing a massive hit to earnings expectations in October, Lehman Brothers in a research note cut its forecasts and said two quarters of contraction are now possible. Credit Suisse First Boston last week increased its estimate of chances of an outright recession for the euro zone to one in three.
CALGARY, Alberta -- Think Canadian natural gas will easily and cheaply cover a U.S. supply shortfall Think again. With U.S. gas producers finding it tough to boost output, Americans are looking north to help satisfy demand. Canada supplies about 16 of the natural-gas consumed by its southern neighbor, up from 11 in 1995. But with its own productive capacity peaking, Canada isn't likely to provide a sustained fix for U.S. gas consumers, specialists here caution. That could lead to a supply crunch when a U.S. economic recovery takes hold. According to most analysts, U.S. demand for natural gas probably will expand steadily in the long term, due mainly to the fuel's increasing use in electricity generation, while domestic supply stays flat. Even in its latest short-term forecast for natural-gas demand -- revised to reflect economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic demand rebounding by 3.9 in 2002 after falling 2 this year. To address anticipated demand growth, U.S. energy companies have been snapping up natural-gas companies and assets in Canada, made cheaper by low natural-gas prices and the strong U.S. dollar. In October, for example, Burlington Resources Inc., Houston, offered 2.1 billion for Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd., Calgary. But doubts are growing about Canada's ability to keep boosting its gas exports in the long run.
The whereabouts of Vice President Cheney have been something of a state secret off and on since Oct. 7, when the United States commenced its assault on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. Citing security concerns, White House officials generally decline to discuss the veep's comings and goings. No wonder Saturday Night Live suggested in a recent skit that Cheney -- like the elusive bin Laden - - is living in a cave in Afghanistan. Yesterday morning, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told inquiring reporters I don't have the vice president's location. But now the mystery is solved. The Post's Mike Allen reports that Cheney has spent the past two days hunting pheasant in South Dakota. Aides confirmed the expedition -- which one called an annual buddy thing and an extended weekend -- after the Associated Press and the Dakota News Network revealed that Air Force Two had landed in Pierre, S.D., at 2 p.m. Sunday. Cheney's pilots gave away the game when they started handing out official souvenir postcards to children in the terminal -- to say nothing of the huge motorcade outside. Aides said Cheney visited his home in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, then moved on to a pheasant preserve near Pierre to keep a long- standing hunting date with friends -- an annual tradition, as one aide described it. But Allen reports that Cheney wasn't all play and no work Yesterday he received his daily intelligence briefing by videoconference and spoke by secure phone with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was in Washington conferring with President Bush. The vice president also hunted the weekend before last in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where his quarry was duck. He hunts everything, an aide told Allen. In one corner of the Greenbelt Marriott were the Washington Redskins at Sunday brunch, loading up on football fuel before their winning game against the Seattle Seahawks. In the other corner were happy conventioneers -- some in tight leather and black lace stockings -- in town to trade info on dominance and submission, bondage and discipline, fetishism and cross-dressing. While the Skins got up for the game, an overflow crowd from the Black Rose 2001 conference at the nearby Ramada New Carrollton attended workshops and lectures with such titles as Foot Fetishism - - It Ain't Just for Bottoms Anymore, Blood Art, Discipline, Obedience, Punishment and Atonement and No End in Sight -- Beyond the Basics of Bondage.
Why is MetLife Inc., a New York-based company with a large number of insurance customers in the World Trade Center, fretting about folks in the heartland Because it expects to pay disability claims to customers far from ground zero. That includes the worker in Kansas City who is having some nervous disorder just because they watch the war on terror on CNN, says Rob Henrikson, president of MetLife's institutional life-insurance business. MetLife has established 83 million in reserves, largely to cover that type of disability claim, though it won't give a specific breakdown. Although the life-insurance industry has taken a relatively light hit from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it nonetheless has been affected by the strikes and their aftermath. Analysts estimate life-insurance companies will have losses of between 3 billion and 6 billion related to Sept. 11, much smaller than the estimated 40 billion to 70 billion in insured losses expected to be paid by property-casualty insurers. Of course, the biggest cost for the industry will be paying life-insurance claims for people killed in the attacks. But the industry is also bracing for an increase in disability claims, and not just from workers hurt in downtown Manhattan. MetLife, which reported a 33 drop in its net income on Tuesday, said disability claims rise anyway during recessions. When the economy worsens there tends to be a pickup in incidents, adds Joan Zief, a life-insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs. The cynic might say that when people are worried about losing their jobs they are more apt to go on disability to maintain an income.
Nearly two months after the Sept. 11 attacks, with the United States tumbling into recession, Congress and the White House remain mired in partisan wrangling over a package of tax cuts and spending increases to revive economic growth. Analysts now warn that if the political stalemate continues past Thanksgiving, the lack of a fiscal stimulus package would deepen the recession and render the eventual recovery less robust while sending stock prices tumbling again on Wall Street. If we're going to limit the severity of a recession, we need to quickly nip this in the bud, said Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. Otherwise, you get a set of dynamics where one layoff leads to another, and the economy can spiral down rather quickly. Economic forecasters differ on how much a package of additional tax cuts and spending increases would boost an economy now weakening faster than most had expected, but all agree it would help. At the most optimistic end, Macroeconomic Advisers of St. Louis calculates that every dollar in additional spending and tax cuts will add 1.50 to economic output over the next 18 months. If another 90 billion in stimulus is added to actions already taken -- roughly the amount in both House and Senate packages -- the U.S. gross domestic product should grow by 3.2 percent next year, up from current projections of a 1.6 percent growth rate without, according to economist Chris Varvares.
Federal Reserve officials concluded early last month that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had pushed the nation into a recession, according to minutes of an Oct. 2 policymaking session released yesterday. Details of the minutes, including the policymakers' conclusion that the economy is in a slump, reinforced the view among many economists that the Fed is not done cutting rates. The economists generally expect the Fed to lower its target to 1.5 percent, probably in two quarter-point steps at meetings scheduled for mid-December and late January. The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the attacks seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity, the members of the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded, the minutes said. Looking ahead, the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty, notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term, they said. The minutes are a summary of the officials' discussions, not a transcript, and the word recession does not appear in the minutes. But the officials clearly were referring to a recession when they used the words, downturn in overall economic activity and said they foresaw a short contraction of the economy.
The government is stepping up its investigation of 1.8 million Jeep Grand Cherokees after receiving hundreds of complaints that the sport-utility vehicle can shift suddenly from park to reverse. Five deaths have been reported. Safety regulators said the investigation involves all Grand Cherokees built in model years 1993 through 2002. Chrysler, which makes the vehicle, said it is investigating the complaints but has found nothing to explain the problem. Most people reported the Grand Cherokee would suddenly go into reverse shortly after they shifted to park and while the vehicle was idling. An investigator with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was able to duplicate the problem while testing one of the vehicles at a Chrysler-Jeep dealership in Virginia. Lucent Technologies said scientists at its Bell Labs unit built a transistor from one molecule, a breakthrough in miniaturization that may lead to faster and cheaper computer chips. A billionth of a meter long, the device is less than one-tenth the size of any other transistor, which switches and amplifies signals in the circuits found in every electronic machine, the company said. By shrinking the size of transistors, manufacturers can produce more powerful, less expensive chips for computers, consumer electronics and networking gear. The number of laid-off workers drawing jobless benefits has reached an 18-year high, although fewer Americans filed new claims for state unemployment assistance. The Labor Department said new jobless claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 46,000, to 450,000, in the workweek ended Nov. 3. The number of laid-off workers continuing to receive unemployment benefits rose to 3.72 million in the workweek ending Oct. 27, the highest level since April 23, 1983. Palm chief executive Carl Yankowski has resigned, the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of handheld computers announced. Chairman Eric Benhamou will take his place until a permanent replacement is named. The Federal Communications Commission is reexamining its radio ownership rules to decide whether it should limit future combinations in small and medium-size markets. A 1996 law raised the number of stations a company may own to between five and eight in a single market, depending on a city's size, from a previous limit of four. Critics say consolidation that followed the adjustment should lead the FCC to update the merger review process. The commission also voted to speed up reviews of pending sales of stations that in some cases have been stuck for years.
When the 1996 welfare reform bill was being debated in Congress, there were numerous predictions from scholars, editorial page writers and politicians that a welfare system that demanded work, imposed sanctions and operated under time limits would result in huge declines in family income and increases in poverty and homelessness. Now comes the U.S. Census Bureau with its data on family income and poverty for 2000, thereby permitting informed judgments about whether welfare reform is driving poor families into the Grate Society. For the seventh year in a row, poverty was down. Further, black and Hispanic households had their lowest poverty rates ever, and the overall child poverty rate was lower than in any year since 1976. Similarly, black and Hispanic households both set records for all-time high incomes. How is the nation making such remarkable progress against poverty and low income The Census Bureau report shows that an important part of the answer is that welfare reform has led to huge increases in work and earnings by single mothers and a revolution in how government helps the poor. No longer does government help the poor primarily by giving them welfare benefits. The new approach is to encourage, cajole and, if necessary, force poor and able-bodied parents to take jobs. Then, once they are employed, government provides help through a system of work supports that includes cash earnings subsidies, primarily through the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC, medical insurance, food subsidies, child care and housing. The Census Bureau data show how this new approach works. Consider the group of about 2 million families headed by mothers with incomes under 13,000. In 1993 this group earned on average only 1,400 and had welfare benefits primarily cash and food stamps of 4,400 all figures are adjusted for inflation. By 2000, their earnings had increased by 130 percent, to 3,100, and their welfare benefits had declined by a quarter to 3,300. In addition, they enjoyed a 300 percent increase in EITC income. The net effect was that total income for these mothers and children rose by a quarter, to 8,600. Now consider the group of 2 million mothers with incomes between 13,000 and 21,000, a group that includes many mothers leaving welfare. Earnings increased from 4,900 in 1993 to 11,700 in 2000. Similarly, EITC income increased by nearly 200 percent. Although the welfare income of mothers in this group fell by nearly 60 percent, their total income increased by more than 4,000, to 17,600.
Gov.-elect Mark R. Warner D expressed surprise today at the severity of state government's fiscal problems but also confidence that the Virginia economy will rebound strongly from an economic recession expected to last at least until summer. Warner, speaking with reporters after a budget briefing by aides to Gov. James S. Gilmore III, said the nearly 1 billion projected budget shortfall disclosed by the Republican administration this week was larger than he expected before he won the governorship 10 days ago. Warner succeeds Gilmore on Jan. 12. This is clearly more challenging than, I think, any of us would have anticipated a few weeks ago, Warner said. But he added We're going to get through this. . . . Virginia will come out of this process stronger. Warner offered no immediate or specific recommendations for closing the budget gap, leaving much of that preliminary work to Gilmore, who will present a final spending plan to the General Assembly shortly. However, the Democrat said he would consider using a Gilmore- endorsed arrangement to win nearly 260 million in Medicaid funds from the federal government. Warner said he would insist on all that money being used for health care, rather than overall budget- balancing.
As holiday shoppers shift into high gear, finding the fastest computer has gotten a little more confusing. It used to be simple. All you had to do was compare three numbers - - the processor speed listed on the box, the price listed on the tag and the balance in your bank account -- and purchase accordingly. Now, however, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is arguing that one of those figures is misleading. While many of us look at a system's processor speed measured in megahertz or, more recently, gigahertz first and foremost, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD says that number doesn't tell the full story. The controversy started with Intel's new Pentium 4 processors, which top out at a faster clock rate than the latest AMD Athlon XP processors. Intel's fastest Pentium 4 runs at 2 GHz, while the Athlon XP maxes out at 1.6 GHz. But the Pentium 4 uses a new architecture that, analysts say, works less efficiently than that of its predecessor. So even though the Pentium 4 runs at a faster clock rate, it's getting slightly less done per clock tick than an AMD chip with the same clock speed -- or even a Pentium III with the same clock speed.
Since Sept. 21, the Nasdaq composite index has roared back 34 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average is up 20 percent, nearly to 10,000, where it had not been since August. Is the market anticipating an economic rally next year Is the country more confident because of military success in Afghanistan Can this stock market recovery last The different answers come from three camps bull, bear and a third group that wonders why the questions are being asked at all. Since the Sept. 11 attacks made the whole world, including the stock market, riskier, some think that valuing stocks at their pre- attack levels is unjustified. For now, the market has moved too far, too fast, said Alan Ackerman, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock and Co. A contraction in the market now would be neither unexpected nor unhealthy. My hesitancy about this market is that absolute valuations are still absurdly high, whether you look at price-to-book ratios, price- to-earnings. . . . They're all off the chart, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
WITH Chelsea Property Group Inc.'s business driven by two things heavily impacted by the Sept. 11 attacks -- tourism and retail sales -- one might expect the outlet-center owner's stock to plummet and the company to lower its earnings projection. But surprisingly, the company has emerged as one of a small number of real-estate investment trusts this year to publicly announce satisfaction with earlier earnings projections. And its total return -- stock price plus dividend paid to shareholders -- has risen 5 since trading resumed after Sept. 11, according to the Morgan Stanley REIT index. REITs overall have risen an average 4 in the same period. To be sure, the Roseland, N.J., REIT looks especially vulnerable, as fears of flying keep would-be travelers -- and shoppers -- home and as the economy has sunk into a recession. But investors seem to be focusing more on Chelsea's earnings, which have risen, than on same-space sales, which have fallen. Chelsea reported 9 growth in per-share, third-quarter funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REITs' financial performance, beating analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson FinancialFirst Call. In addition, company officials expect an immediate earnings boost from Chelsea's 180 million acquisition of 31 retail properties from Konover Property Trust Inc., Raleigh, N.C. The deal was completed Sept. 25. It's a good news, bad news thing, says Lee Schalop, analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, with the good news winning out. They have some bad news on sales but they bought some assets at incredibly attractive prices, with extremely high returns. Those high returns will flow through their bottom line in 2002.
The House of Representatives will soon vote on the question of granting the president Trade Promotion Authority, also known as fast-track approval. Some in Congress have argued that now is not the time to take up legislation that has encountered such fierce protectionist opposition in recent years. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the current economic slowdown, it is all the more important that Congress move quickly to approve this vital measure. This bipartisan action would inspire confidence in global capital markets. It would allow America to be seen as continuing to lead the open trade and globalization that has been so vital to the prosperity of both developed and developing countries. And it would send a powerful message that the president and Congress speak with one voice, and are committed to advancing freer trade as part of the war on terror. Indeed, approval of TPA would signal that the U.S. is not only seeking a military coalition, but an economic one. The benefits of trade hardly need illuminating. America's exports accounted for approximately one-third of our extraordinary economic growth over the past decade, and exports now support over 12 million American jobs nearly three million more than a decade ago. Jobs supported by exports typically pay 13 to 18 more than comparable employment. Trade brings real economic benefits to the U.S. The North American Free Trade Agreement, and the completion of the previous round of trade negotiations the Uruguay Round, now generate annual income gains of 1,300 to 2,000 for the average American family of four. Trade is also fundamental to economic growth in the developing world. A recent World Bank study shows that nations open to trade grow 3.5 times faster than nations closed to trade. The recent experience of countries such as South Korea, China and Chile underscore that trade is a pathway to prosperity. Trade is a two-way street, and imports also benefit the U.S. They provide consumers with more choices and lower prices on a wide variety of goods. Imports also force our industries to constantly improve and innovate in order to remain competitive with foreign exporters.
DAYTON, Ohio -- Two competing grocery stores have been creating traffic jams with an old-fashioned gas war -- and old-fashioned prices, as low as a dime a gallon. Kroger Co., the nation's largest grocery chain, opened a new store on Thursday about a quarter-mile from a Meijer store. Both stores, as part of a growing trend toward one-stop shopping, have gas pumps outside. The price war began heating up within a few hours of the Kroger store's opening. As soon as one station dropped its price, the other countered with a lower price. You have to take advantage of it while you can, Matt Harris said. Gas may never be this cheap again. On Friday morning, the price of gasoline at the Meijer was back up to 1.12 a gallon. But by noon, it was down to 71 cents a gallon, and it fell to 51 cents by early evening.
INDIANAPOLIS -- Kathy G. Reehling is the accidental entrepreneur, running a 30 million-a-year temporary-staffing and technical-services firm essentially because she keeps saying yes to one very big client. Keeping that client, Eli Lilly & Co., the big pharmaceutical concern, happy the past 10 years has been all-consuming for Ms. Reehling and her firm, Crew Corp. But now, with 130 employees and facing her first recession as a boss, Ms. Reehling is being forced to confront her overdependence on Lilly and consider whether the worker-friendly policies that helped build Crew can survive in a downturn. About 85 of Crew's revenue today comes from Lilly. They're an absolutely fabulous customer, Ms. Reehling says, but Lilly's too big a piece of our business. That realization, and the recession, are forcing Ms. Reehling, 42 years old, to attempt to think and act strategically about her business -- as opposed to merely reacting to her dominant customer's needs. The work for Lilly remains strong. But can Ms. Reehling attract other customers to diversify Crew's revenue base Can she avoid layoffs and thus maintain Crew's high worker-retention rate in an industry plagued by turnover Should she sell the business to one of the many temporary-services firms looking to merge that come calling Many entrepreneurs come to such a crossroads after a long run of growth. And which road they take can make or break a successful company. It's easier, of course, when the business was actually started with a plan and a vision. Ms. Reehling wasn't thinking of starting a temp business when she went to work for Lilly.
SINGAPORE -- There was bad news almost everywhere they looked yesterday but investors chose instead to focus on the bright side in Asia, pushing many regional stock markets to healthy gains amid hopes of a U.S. recovery in the new year. Those gains came on a day when the ripples from the demise of energy giant Enron Corp. continued to spread, Japan saw its sovereign credit rating downgraded to the same level as Italy by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Argentina's troubles again raised the question of a contagion effect for emerging markets in Asia. But it was evidence of renewed consumer spending in the U.S. that sent investors into the markets to buy technology stocks in places like Taiwan, where the local index rose 2.6 to a three-month high of 4766. A 2.9 rise in U.S. consumer spending in October, plus optimistic signs in construction spending data and a key purchasing managers' report, led some to see momentum building toward a U.S. recovery in the second quarter of next year. Add the belief of many that Asian technology stocks have hit bottom and you have the elements for a sustained rally in regional markets, suggests Markus Rosgen, Asia strategist for ING Barings in Hong Kong. It's a real move up because there's a much higher likelihood of a recovery in the U.S. than there was three months ago, he said.
The U.S. Postal Service posted a 1.7 billion loss for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, despite productivity gains, chief financial officer Richard Strasser said yesterday. The Postal Service delivered mail to 1.7 million new addresses with fewer workers and work hours than last year. It has cut 22,500 jobs in the last two years. But mail volume declines, a delay in carrying out the latest rate increase, and costs associated with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks contributed to the loss, he said. Despite the deficits, the Postal Service is awarding 124.5 million in pay for performance bonuses to 52,000 supervisors and managers who have met various productivity and safety targets, Strasser said. The bonuses average 1,500 per participant, he said. Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, the Taliban, Afghanistan and Iraq are named as defendants in a public interest law firm's 210 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court here on behalf of the estate of a woman killed in the World Trade Center attack. Drawing on media reports and recent books by journalists, the conservative law firm Judicial Watch said Mohammad Atta and other Sept. 11 terrorists had met with Iraqi officials and that bin Laden had run a training camp near Baghdad.
The nation's jobless rate jumped to 5.7 percent last month, the highest level in more than six years, as the recession drove employers in most industries to shed workers and cut costs. Nearly a half million people joined the ranks of the unemployed in November, bringing the total to 8.2 million, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The increase from 5.4 percent in October was evidence of the continued sharp deterioration of the job market since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the economy slowed over the past year, unemployment had been rising slowly, from a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in October 2000, before shooting up in the past two months, when 1.1 million more people lost their jobs. The layoffs continued even as signs mounted that the recession that began last spring may be close to running its course, according to several forecasters, some of whom have begun predicting that the economy may start growing again early next year. Even if the recession does end soon, many forecasters expect the unemployment rate to continue rising for several months, reaching 6.5 percent or so next year before it begins to come down. That's because at the end of a slump, as demand picks up, employers can usually boost production without having to hire more workers, which they usually don't want to do until they are sure how strong the recovery will be.
The U.S. economy might not be getting back on its feet quite as quickly as some investors have come to believe. The unemployment rate jumped to 5.7 in November, its highest level in more than six years, the Labor Department said Friday. Employers cut payrolls by 331,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, taking steam out of some economists' predictions that the U.S. economy had begun to crawl out of recession. Those predictions have helped to fuel a rally in the stock market, but the market lost ground Friday in the face of the bearish economic data, which was one of the first full glimpses of how the economy fared in November. Economists said the jobs report removed any lingering doubts that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates for the 11th time in the past 12 months when it meets tomorrow. We're still in a recession and the door is still open to easing monetary policy, said Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist. He, like many others, expects the Fed to reduce the benchmark federal-funds rate by one quarter of a percentage point to 1.75, its lowest level since 1961.
Corrections & Amplifications A SURVEY by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found that 70 of respondents believe the recession will end by April. An article yesterday incorrectly reported that 70 of the respondents predicted the recession wouldn't end until April. WSJ Dec. 12, 2001 NEW YORK -- Just two weeks ago, a recession was officially declared to have begun in March. Now a small group of bullish economists is declaring that it already is over, or nearly so. The group, led by Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics and Ed Hyman at ISI Group Inc., is decidedly out on a limb. Most other economists are forecasting that the economy will continue to contract during the current quarter, and a recovery will begin in the spring or summer at the earliest. The Federal Reserve, meeting today, is expected to cut its target for short-term interest rates for the eleventh time this year to 1.75 from 2 amid concerns over economic weakness. With unemployment rising and the global economy on the ropes, Fed officials are expected to indicate they remain more inclined to lower rates than raise them. There was little reason to be optimistic after Friday's release of the employment report for November. Among other things, the report said the unemployment rate jumped to 5.7 last month -- the highest level in six years -- while the economy lost 331,000 jobs.
LENNOX, CALIF. -- Something strange washed over this area following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 quiet. With planes grounded across the U.S., residents of this crowded community abutting Los Angeles airport weren't assaulted by the sound of jet engines for the first time in anybody's memory. The sudden silence was so at odds with the usual deafening roar that kids were scared by it, says Maria Van Deventer, assistant principal at Jefferson Elementary School. Today, planes are once again buzzing just 300 feet above the heads of the people of Lennox. But something even scarier has befallen them. The meltdown in the travel and tourism business has claimed thousands of their jobs. As much as any place in America, this 1.3-square-mile unincorporated area of Los Angeles County has been the victim of post-Sept. 11 economic fallout. Because this is practically a company town, with many of its 23,000 residents employed at the third busiest airport in the world and related businesses, Lennox has become a ground zero of sorts for the devastated travel and tourism industry. The impact of the near collapse in the industry has left a broad footprint. Airline industry revenue should decline 30 in the fourth quarter over the year-earlier period, estimates Kevin C. Murphy of Morgan Stanley, and PKF Consulting estimates that room revenue at hotels in major urban centers will be down 17.5. Other travel-dependent firms, from airline caterers to airport concession owners, have also been hit hard.
Waiting for Congress to pass the much-needed economic stimulus bill is beginning to look like waiting for Godot. Fortunately for the U.S. economy, two large private industries -- automobiles and homebuilding -- have stepped up to provide the stimulus that the government has thus far failed to deliver. There is a great irony here. A clear function of government -- combating recessions -- is being performed by the private sector. But there's actually a double irony, for government policies have been instrumental in enabling each of these industries to accomplish what it has. The auto industry's contribution has been more spectacular but will be less durable. Right after the terrorist attacks, industry executives saw some pretty bad-looking handwriting on the wall and reacted quickly -- in what they perceived to be their companies' best interest. They offered buyers 0 percent financing, a head-turning discount that filled the nation's showrooms and produced record sales just when the economy most needed the additional spending. Thank you, Detroit. I don't pretend to know whether 0 percent financing made good business sense for GM, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler. After all, it's costly -- the auto finance companies that lend you money at no interest do not get their funds for free. But it did succeed in driving auto sales to record highs while other categories of consumer spending were slumping, which is quite a feat. The 0 percent financing programs thus amounted to a kind of privatized stimulus policy -- wonderfully timed, well-targeted and effective. Would that Congress had done so well. But notice that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate cuts made it all possible. If short-term interest rates were as high today as they were in January, free auto loans would probably have been too expensive for Detroit. I doubt that people at the Fed were thinking about 0 percent financing when they started cutting interest rates back in January. But monetary policy sometimes works in unexpected ways. The story in housing may be less dramatic, but it is much longer lasting. As the economy weakened before the terrorist attacks, observers marveled at how well the housing sector was holding up. This industry acted as a pillar of strength supporting the U.S. economy in at least two ways. First, homes continued to be built in large numbers even while much of the rest of the economy slipped. Second, millions of American households obtained immediate cash by refinancing their mortgages at lower rates they then spent some of this money on consumer goods.
A French Moroccan man was charged yesterday with helping Osama bin Laden and the 19 hijackers plan the Sept. 11 attacks. Zacarias Moussaoui was already in jail when the terrorists struck on Sept. 11. He had tried to take flying lessons last summer, but flight schools officials were suspicious of the reasons he gave for studying flying and called the police. Soon after, he was arrested and charged with breaking U.S. immigration laws. The government says that Moussaoui had been trained in terrorist camps run by bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist organization in Afghanistan. Moussaoui was charged three months after the attacks. He was the first person to be charged with a crime connected with Sept. 11. The Federal Reserve, the part of the government that orders coins to be minted, ordered too many. There are 2.4 billion pennies, 480 million nickels, 470 million dimes, 1.8 billion quarters, 62 million half-dollars and 192 million Sacagawea golden dollars stuffed into government vaults and armored cars around the country.
Yahoo Inc. made an unsolicited offer to buy HotJobs Inc. for 436 million in cash and stock, topping a friendly all-stock bid from TMP Worldwide Inc. that was announced at the end of June. Yahoo made its offer in the form of a bear hug, in which a would-be buyer sends a letter to the target and then discloses it in an effort to pressure the target to negotiate. It is Yahoo's first unsolicited takeover effort. HotJobs, New York, declined to comment. TMP Worldwide President and Chief Operating Officer James Treacey said, We have a binding contract with HotJobs that we intend to fulfill. New York-based TMP isn't worried about Yahoo's bid. What Yahoo is thinking, I don't know, Mr. Treacey said. The latest offer, which values HotJobs, an Internet help-wanted site, at 10.50 a share, comes as Yahoo is seeking to broaden its offerings beyond advertising, which makes up about 80 of its annual revenues. Advertising in general is in the midst of one of the worst slumps in a decade, and the Web-portal company's revenue has fallen precipitously this year, partly due to the slump. Yahoo's move to wrest HotJobs from TMP, which runs the Monster.com jobs Web site, comes as that deal is undergoing intense regulatory scrutiny.
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks fell as the technology and telecommunications sectors tumbled following a wave of profit warnings and layoff announcements. The overall Nasdaq market also slid sharply lower, with the Nasdaq Composite Index of both large and small stocks posting the steepest declines of the major stock-market measures. Several leading tech and telecom companies let it be known that their fourth-quarter results will be weak, with several announcing job cutbacks. While most of those companies are large-caps, their roles as industry leaders causes their outlooks and action to reverberate throughout the tech and telecom sectors, which are key components of the small-cap market. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 6.64, or 1.40, to 468.67, and the Nasdaq composite, at 1946.51, lost 64.87, or 3.23. The latest round of layoff announcements and profit warnings, are causing people to be concerned about the extent of the recession, said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. Stocks had run up the past few weeks on the idea that the worst of the economic downturn has passed, and that a recovery was imminent. But it appears that the market has run too far, too fast, Mr. Ackerman said.
The Wall Street JournalNBC News poll WAR AND RECESSION don't shake Americans' belief the U.S. is on track. Seven of 10 say the nation is headed in the right direction in a poll for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, hardly changed from the record 72 who said so in a pre-Sept. 11 survey. It's a remarkable finding, says Republican Robert Teeter, who conducts the poll with Democrat Peter Hart. Both hail Americans' perspective amid tumult. Bush enjoys a majority coalition, Teeter says. The president's job approval remains high at 85, and 80 have positive views of him personally. Even 72 of Democrats approve of his performance 61 have a positive view of him. Congress scores higher, too 57 approve of the job it is doing.
The collapse of the stock market -- of any stock market -- is one of the few truly predictable events in this life. With remarkable certainty, we know that prices will rise to ridiculous peaks and then plunge or collapse to ridiculous lows. The timing, alas, is a mystery. We have learned, however, that just before crashes and prolonged bear markets, the country often gets happy, even giddy over the market's doing so well so long. Shrewd market watchers take this as the surest sign that a bull market is in the throes of death, even before the decline becomes visible. Maury Klein's Rainbow's End recounts the national zaniness that coincided with the decision by millions of Americans to step into the stock market for the first time in the mid- and late 1920s. Many argued that the country's economy had entered a new era of prosperity, as President Calvin Coolidge expressed it. Who, after all, could argue with what Frederick Lewis Allen later called a ceaseless flow of new delights the automobile, the telephone, movies, radios, refrigerators, record players In corporate boardrooms, something called scientific management was taking hold to replace the apparently unscientific management of days gone by, when managers simply did what they thought would make money. For the first time in the 1920s, Wall Street firms marketed stocks to the public en masse. The number of investment trusts, the precursors to today's mutual funds, increased sixfold, with more attention paid to the big names running the funds than to the funds' potential risks and benefits. The number of Americans owning stocks shot from about 500,000 to 15 million. On Oct. 15, 1929, Yale professor Irving Fisher declared infamously, in hindsight that stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. Nine days later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began a long and steep plunge that stripped the market of 40 percent of its value in three weeks and continued, with a few interruptions, into 1932. All I lost was two hundred and forty thousand dollars, Groucho Marx said later. I would have lost more but that was all the money I had. The apparent parallels between the period before the crash of 1929 the New Era and the period that led to the market collapse of 2000 and early 2001 the New Economy are obvious and have been noted ad nauseum anecdotally in the financial press for two years. Klein, a historian of business and finance, evidently thought it beyond his mission to use the opportunity to explore the similarities, which would have made the book more pointed and useful as a vivid reminder of the ever-present risks intrinsic to equities, which are casually ignored as professionals strive to keep alive the mythology that however bleak the moment, everything will be fine if investors just hold on long enough. One wonders how many investors are aware that after 1929, the Dow didn't regain its pre-crash level until 1954. Twenty-five years is a lot of holding on. Klein's book is not the best place to absorb the market's history. It's painfully slow. It advances no particularly new angles or theories. In its lack of analysis, it doesn't demonstrate why the crash is a pivotal moment in American history fit for inclusion in the Oxford University Press's series of the same name. The author could not resist the common tendency to see every event as either causal or emblematic of the main event of the '29 crash. Klein suggests, for example, that the fad of flagpole sitting and the craze for flying in the '20s were somehow symbolic of the idea that the market could defy gravity. He is equally unconvincing in his efforts to connect everyone from Babe Ruth to evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to a mood of escapism somehow connected with the stock market.
NEW YORK -- The Securities Industry Association sees 2002 as a recovery year for the brokerage and investment-banking sector. In a conference call, Frank A. Fernandez, SIA's chief economist and director of research, said the securities industry hit a trough during the third quarter and is beginning a recovery in the fourth. Economic recoveries in the securities industry tend to happen about six to nine months before the overall U.S. economy, he said. For the first time in quite some time, we have some good news, Mr. Fernandez said. The securities industry is in a recovery mode from a severe downturn. Mr. Fernandez said the industry's turnaround was facilitated by the speed with which the industry responded to the events of Sept. 11, most notably how quickly the markets reopened. World-wide holding-company profits of U.S. securities industry for 2001 are expected to reach 28.2 billion, down 51 from 58 billion last year. Profits for 2002 are expected to improve by 14, however, to 32.1 billion.
The retiring Republican governor goes on an end-of-term spending spree to make his successor look like a tight-fisted Scrooge. And the emboldened speaker of the House of Delegates reconfigures his expanded GOP majority to maximize its strength in the General Assembly. The Democratic governor-elect must watch where he treads after outgoing Gov. James S. Gilmore III and House Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr. are finished with their pre-inaugural maneuvers. The audacious governor has been merrily spending money he doesn't have, while the wily Wilkins is making it much easier for his GOP leadership team to exert even more control over state affairs. Warner is outwardly unfazed by the Republican scheming, although he did flash a little exasperation Monday when Gilmore stepped all over his successor's story of the day -- naming Virginia's new Democratic education secretary -- by adding yet another item to his unusually long list of Christmas wishes. That day, Gilmore was asking for passage of a constitutional amendment to erase the car tax from the books once and for all -- and to replace that 1 billion of annual income to localities with a permanent share of income taxes. It looked defensible on paper, but Warner and even some Republicans at the county level started asking tough questions right away about the long-term reliability of that funding to local governments. The governor has been acting as though Jan. 12 is the start of his second term, not Warner's first. Armed with the magic credit card of state bonding capacity, Gilmore said he would include in his final budget tens of millions of additional dollars for historically black colleges, anti-terrorism plans, teacher raises and college construction. And then he dared to ask for what he called the capstone to car-tax relief, its permanent repeal in the form of a constitutional amendment.
Alan Cowan said he's never been late paying his credit card bills. So he was surprised this spring when he opened his First USA bill and found an important notice that said in small print that his 9.99 percent interest rate was going up to 19.49 percent. No reason was given for the increase, but when Cowan called for an explanation he was told that in spite of his spotless record at First USA, he was delinquent and had high balances with other creditors. Cowan disputed the delinquencies and said that high balances were declining as he paid them off. When First USA declined to change his rate back to 9.99 percent, he closed his account. The California computer consultant is one of a growing number of credit card customers who have discovered a not-so-fine reality in the fine print of most credit card issuers. It doesn't matter if consumers are current on one credit card if they fall behind -- or become too indebted -- to another company, the first credit card firm may, and often does, raise its rate. If we see you're becoming delinquent with other creditors, there's a chance you may become delinquent with us, Citibank spokeswoman Maria Mendler said. First USA spokesman David Webster said We think it's a prudent lending practice. You must provide your product based on the risk that exists, and if that risk changes, then a lender needs to make changes to accommodate that.
Curled up on sidewalks and jammed into crowded shelters, the masses of homeless men, women and children in this city have reached record numbers, surpassing the worst levels of the last recession. About 29,400 homeless live in city shelters and hot-plate hotel rooms each night, including 12,500 children. They are the face of a poor New York that supposedly vanished after the early 1990s. Now they are everywhere. A decaying economy and, even more important, a severe lack of affordable housing have driven the current crisis. In the past few years, housing costs in New York's poor neighborhoods have spiked sharply, rising far faster than in wealthy districts. Homelessness has jumped 13 percent nationwide this year. In Chicago, homelessness jumped 22 percent, in San Francisco, 20 percent. In Washington, the number of homeless families has risen by 32 percent -- after four years of decline. D.C. Village, the city's intake shelter for families, is at capacity, and about 600 men and women bed down each night on city streets. The problem is most pronounced in the Northeast, where rental housing costs are among the nation's highest. In Massachusetts, there has been a 40 percent rise in homeless families since August 1999. It's exploded on us, said Dick Powers of the state's homeless agency. The reason is very simple There's no affordable housing.
Once the uncool cousin to high-flying dot-coms, government contractors adopted a new swagger in 2001. The industry continued a trend toward consolidation that strengthened already large companies going after ever-larger federal contracts. Nearly across the board, stock in such companies surged after Sept. 11. An extreme example was CACI International Inc. of Arlington, the stock price of which nearly doubled before a 2-for-1 split in November. Expectations for the sector are high. Before the terrorist attacks, the federal government was expected to spend 46.3 billion on information technology this fiscal year, which ends next September. Now, the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association predicts that federal spending on information technology will jump to 49 billion this fiscal year and reach 65 billion in fiscal 2007. As the government focuses on homeland security, federal agencies are considering how to secure their computer networks and continue to offer more services to the public on the Internet.
The other day I visited my local bank and bought 30 each of French francs, German marks and Italian lire. I have no immediate need for them or the Spanish pesetas, Greek drachmas or Dutch guilders that I might also have purchased. I just wanted some historic mementos, because after Jan. 1 the national currencies of 12 European countries with 305 million people are scheduled to disappear in favor of the euro. Although I have long doubted the euro's benefits, the moment is undeniably historic. Never before have so many people in so many countries simultaneously adopted a new money. Since 1999 stores and banks have priced in both euros and national currency now people get the real stuff. The conversion is a massive operation. The European Central Bank ECB has minted 52 billion new coins 170 for each person in the euro area and printed 14.9 billion bank notes 49 per person. The total value is 649 billion euros, which, at present exchange rates 1 euro equals about 90 cents, is about 584 billion. Throughout history, money -- its creation or destruction -- has always been a political act. The euro has been controversial precisely because it engages vast political ambitions. To critics, it represents a step toward a European super-state that will submerge the individuality of the European nations in an unwieldy federation, hobbled by bureaucracy that imposes a crippling burden of regulatory and other costs on Europe's economies, wrote one British commentator. Having reservations, three of the European Union's 15 members -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden -- have so far rejected the euro. To its enthusiasts, the euro means economic vitality and political unity. Companies won't have to convert all those different currencies. Easier cross-border price comparisons will compel firms to become more efficient. As cross-border investment rises, money will increasingly go to the most deserving companies. Economic success will strengthen a European consciousness. Let's hope so. But I'm skeptical, because I fear that a the euro won't create major economic gains and that b it will trigger a political backlash. So much economic power is being centralized in Frankfurt and Brussels -- the homes of the ECB and the European Commission -- that local and global economic discontent may focus increasingly on Europe as the villain.
Apple Computer Inc., in a bid to increase its retail presence and boost market share, said it plans about 200 million in capital expenditures in the current fiscal year. According to the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker's annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Apple's capital expenditure for fiscal 2002 will go toward replacing existing capital assets, improving its corporate infrastructure and developing more Apple-branded retail stores. Apple, which launched 27 of its own retail stores across the country this year, devoted about 92 million to the initiative during its fiscal 2001 ended Sept. 30, out of total captial spending of 232 million, according to the filing. More Apple stores are being planned for fiscal 2002, the filing states, but didn't specify how many. Apple's total capital-expenditure plans, while down from a year earlier, underline its effort to continue reaching out to customers through company-owned stores. The computer maker, which has world-wide market share of about 5, has long maintained that customers need to feel and touch its Macintosh systems in order to fully appreciate the products. Since Apple opened its first stores in May 2001, the company has followed a model of locating stores in high-traffic locations such as urban shopping districts and malls. In addition to selling its own computers, Apple's stores also carry a variety of third-party software and devices such as video cameras and hand-held computers. The company originally anticipated that its stores would break even by early next year, but modified those expectations after the Sept. 11 attacks. Apple now expects the stores to generate a small loss for fiscal 2002, the filing states.
Video production editor Fritz Flad, 34, was taken aback last month when his boss called him into the office and terminated his job. It was the first time Flad had ever been laid off. He got another surprise when District officials directed him to the AFL-CIO union headquarters, two blocks from the White House, to file his claim for unemployment benefits. When they told me to go to the AFL building, I thought that must be a mistake, Flad said in an interview last month, as he filled out the paperwork in a large room normally used as the union officials' lunchroom. Flad said that it was his first contact in his professional life with a union and that previously he had viewed unions with disdain. Now, he is rethinking that attitude, he said. A lot of white-collar jobs are turning into electronic sweatshops, said Flad, who lives in Rockville. Sooner or later, I think more of them will turn to unions. The AFL cafeteria-turned-unemployment center is one example of many around the country where unions have begun offering services to members and to other needy workers who lost their jobs after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 devastated an already troubled hospitality industry. These services help unions as they struggle to maintain links to workers who might otherwise leave the fold. In Los Angeles, the County Federation of Labor is dispensing 3 million in aid to unemployed hotel and airport workers to help them keep their health insurance current and pay utility bills.
Deep into the all-important year-end renewal season for insurance contracts, big insurance buyers in many cases are choosing to either carry no terrorism coverage or opting for low-level coverage, leaving themselves vulnerable in the event of future attacks. The big reason buyers are turning down the specialized coverage, whose value was illustrated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is it has become simply too expensive, in many cases costing more than a company's basic commercial coverage. There is terrorism coverage available, but it's at outrageous prices, said Bob Spadaccia, senior vice president for the Northeast at USI Insurance Services Corp., a San Francisco insurance broker. Real-estate companies and any other entities that are required, either by law or, in some cases, by lenders, to buy the terrorism coverage are choking on the numbers, he said. Prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, which are estimated to be costing the insurance industry at least 40 billion, such terrorism coverage was included as part of a standard policy. Now, terrorism coverage is being stripped out of the policies offered to most large businesses and owners of properties viewed by insurance companies as the likeliest targets, including tall office buildings, sports stadiums and shopping malls. These businesses are being offered the chance to buy back the coverage, but only at the steep prices. USI estimates only about one in 10 such clients is opting to buy back the coverage. Smaller, lower-profile businesses are less affected by the insurance industry's retrenchment. They are generally still able to get terrorism coverage as part of a basic package, albeit at higher prices than they paid last year, brokers said.
NEW YORK -- On your mark. Get set. Go . . . slowly. The nation's hopes for a fast start aside, forecasters don't expect the U.S. economy to be off to the races this year. Although they see America breaking out of recession, most believe the pace of the recovery will be subpar. This will be a year of convalescence, and the debate in my view is not whether recovery is coming, it's how strong it will be, says Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Until recently, Morgan Stanley was among the more bearish firms on Wall Street regarding the economy. But yesterday, the company issued a report saying the recession appears to be ending. The consensus estimate of the 55 economists who participated in The Wall Street Journal's economic-forecasting survey calls for real gross domestic product -- the value of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- to rise at an annual rate of just 0.87 during the first quarter and 2.4 during the second quarter. But the forecasters see the economy picking up momentum during the second half of the year, with growth rising 3.6. The government won't release estimates for growth in the just-ended fourth quarter until later this month, but most economists are expecting a contraction of more than 1.
The U.S. Postal Service and the country's largest mailers are close to agreeing on a compromise that would boost postage rates as soon as June but stave off an even bigger increase threatened by the post office in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the recession. The deal, which includes accepting the Postal Service's proposal of late September to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents, follows two months of negotiations aimed at avoiding skirmishes that usually cause the rate-setting process to drag on for about a year. The settlement calls for the higher rates to take effect at least three months earlier than the October implementation the Postal Service originally projected, giving the agency a much-needed revenue infusion. The agency reported a 1.7 billion loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2001, and it has predicted a similar result for the current fiscal year. The compromise still must clear several hurdles and could fall apart if not enough of the 58 companies, industry groups and other parties in the pending rate-increase case support the deal. A Postal Service spokesman said about two-thirds of the parties had indicated by yesterday's deadline they would go along with the settlement the agency's board will decide early next week whether to endorse the deal, which it is expected to do. Jerry Cerasale, senior vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, the largest trade group for the direct-mail industry, said there are a significant number of major parties that have at least informally stated that they would sign the agreement . . . or will not oppose it. Mr. Cerasale's group agreed to the compromise after the Postal Service abandoned its push for a settlement that would have boosted postal rates June 2, instead of the current plan of no sooner than June 30, giving mailers more time to prepare for the rate increases.
EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- The head of Philips Electronics NV is aiming to make 2002 a lot better than 2001. Europe's largest consumer-electronics company suffered like many others from the global economic downturn and a plunge in consumer spending that worsened after the terrorist attacks in the U.S. Next month, the company is expected to report its first full-year loss in nearly a decade. Its stock has lost 15 of its value over the past 52 weeks, closing yesterday at 33.60 euros. But Chief Executive Gerard Kleisterlee intends to revive Philips, partly with a restructuring that he says will save the company several times what it expected to save when announcing the plan in November. Philips has not grown in the past 10 years, he said in an interview, and my aim in the New Year is to stop this decline. For starters, he said, the restructuring planned for this year -- which aims to curb costs and cut about 12,000 jobs -- could save the company as much as one billion euros 895 million a year, compared with the 300 million euros initially projected. Mr. Kleisterlee said additional job reductions are in the works, and that Philips is looking for a buyer for its contract-manufacturing services business, which analysts figure could fetch as much as 800 million euros.
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has now staked out his and his party's economic policies, and -- in tune with the styles of today -- they're retro. The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse. To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits as far as the eye could see thereafter. Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election. Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, stayed the course. Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined. The nation shook off the strange combination of slow growth and inflation that characterized the Carter years and grew at a healthy rate through the rest of the 1980s. The stock market, recognizing that a new and different economic policy had taken hold in Washington, surged to unprecedented levels.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials appear to be less optimistic about economic recovery than many private analysts, and that suggests interest rates could remain low for a while or even fall again. I believe recovery will occur around mid-2002 -- a few months later than the median forecast predicts, Anthony Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech. He was one of five Fed officials to speak so far this week. Their comments, while more upbeat than they have been for months, suggest they are less impressed with the run of positive economic reports, ranging from capital-goods orders to home sales, than private forecasters and investors. Mr. Santomero, for example, said it may take longer than expected for companies to rebuild inventories, something optimistic analysts are counting on to generate higher production and an imminent recovery. He said consumer spending, though resilient so far, could retrench if big layoffs persist. A Wall Street Journal poll of 54 forecasters found that two-thirds expect the economy to grow in the current quarter, and almost all expect growth in the next quarter. But Fed officials see more risks. Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said in a speech that while the consensus forecast is the most probable outcome . . . I think there's a good chance that the economy may be at least a little softer than the consensus over the next year or so. He cited the risk that continued weak profits will hold back business investment. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Jack Guynn said the economy would probably contract for another quarter or two. While he cited several positive forces for significant recovery, including low energy prices and interest rates, he projected second-half growth of around 3, less than the 3.6 consensus, at an annual rate.
Merrill Lynch & Co., taking strong medicine to deal with a weak market, announced one of the steepest retrenchments on Wall Street in recent years. The nation's largest securities firm said it will take a 2.2 billion fourth-quarter charge partly to pay for about 9,000 job cuts it says were necessary to reduce expenses amid a business slowdown. Though the restructuring was expected -- The Wall Street Journal reported on the large potential job cuts and charge in October -- yesterday was the first time Merrill confirmed the move. Merrill says the work-force reduction is part of a plan to cut costs by 1.4 billion a year, a move it hopes will boost profitability. Most of the job cuts, representing nearly 14 of its work force, came in the last three months of 2001. In total, the firm cut 15,000 positions in 2000 and now employs about 57,000 people. About 1.2 billion of the charge is related to staff severance costs. The nature of this process we don't anticipate repeating, Thomas Patrick, Merrill's chief financial officer told analysts yesterday in a conference call. The charge came as no surprise to investors. In a recent research note, Bear Stearns Cos. analyst Amy Butte predicted a charge of as much as 2.1 billion was in the works. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Merrill shares were up 1.49, or 2.6, to 57.93.
Led by government and enlightened, focused civil-rights leaders, African-Americans have made extraordinary progress. Forty years ago many couldn't vote, eat at public lunch counters, or earn a decent wage. Problems do persist, however. Blacks only make 70 as much as whites almost seven in ten African-American babies are born to a single mother and minorities are twice as likely to be without health insurance. The black unemployment rate last month was over 10, double that of whites, and one third of African-American teenagers looking for work are jobless. So how are two of the most visible national black politicians, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, spending their time Protesting against supposed slights to Harvard's Afro-American studies professors. This shrill and silly conduct reinforces the political bankruptcy of these national black politicos. Jesse Jackson has made important contributions to politics and civil rights now he looks like a headline-hunting ambulance chaser. Al Sharpton may be shrewd, but this performance, coupled with his past demagoguery, makes it impossible to treat his threatened 2004 presidential run seriously. The Harvard furor emerged a few weeks ago when it was leaked that a member of the university's prized Afro-American Studies Department, Cornel West, was offended by a session with Harvard's new president, Larry Summers. Mr. Summers reportedly urged Professor West, one of only fourteen University Professors at Harvard, to engage in more scholarly research and join in the battle against grade inflation. Mr. West's recent major work had been a rap CD, while more than 90 of Harvard undergraduates receive honors and almost half the grades given out are As.
CAN PRICES GO any lower in San Francisco Will war benefit home sellers in Los Angeles And how much more expensive will homes nationally be this year than last The answers Yes, maybe and just a bit, according to the most recent Home Price Forecast done by Case Shiller Weiss, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, for The Wall Street Journal. But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up. Home prices nationally will once again climb over the coming year, by an average of 2.8. In fact, out of the 20 cities tracked, only two won't see prices rise, the forecasters say. Still, the upswing will be remarkably varied across the country, with some cities, such as San Diego, barely squeaking ahead prices are expected to go up by just 0.8 there, while others, like Washington, D.C., should boast a robust jump of more than 7. And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year. We're not out of the woods yet, says the firm's Karl Case, who takes into account past sale prices, the number of homes on the market and the number of people setting up new households when making his predictions. Patrick and Sharon Brem discovered that for themselves when they recently tried to sell their loft in downtown San Francisco. That market has been one of the hardest hit in recent months and the economists say prices will drop by an additional 5.7 this year, making it the only city in the survey where they'll actually fall. The Brems were asking 969,000 for their place, but settled for 730,000 -- or exactly what they paid for it two years ago. We consider ourselves lucky to get out when we did, says Mrs. Brem, an Internet developer. A lot of people haven't been able to find buyers The number of sales there fell by 27 in November from the year before. Home prices were flagging even before Sept. 11 -- in the first quarter of 2001, the National Association of Realtors found that prices had started downward in more than a quarter of the 128 major metro areas it tracks. And they were down in the immediate aftermath of the attacks -- September median new home prices dropped 5.1, while those of existing homes fell 3.6. But overall, the housing market has held its ground remarkably well despite the shaky economy, propped up by numerous interest-rate cuts and consumer faith in the housing market. During the third quarter of last year, inflation-adjusted prices nationally rose 6.1 from a year earlier, according to the federal government.
Freed from its tether to the U.S. dollar for the first time in more than a decade, the Argentine peso is expected to come under renewed pressure this week as the government works out how to untangle bank-account restrictions and financial institutions become more active in foreign-exchange markets. The peso lost about 40 of its value Friday, the first day of trading since the government last week replaced Argentina's one-to-one peg with the dollar with a dual exchange-rate system. Under the new system, trade and some financial transactions will be covered by a fixed exchange rate of 1.40 pesos to the dollar, while Argentines seeking to buy or sell dollars for other transactions will have to do so on the open market where the peso will float freely. In Friday's trading, the peso closed around 1.70 pesos to the dollar, but the bulk of activity was at the small exchange houses that had languished during the past decade when the dollar and peso were used side by side. Banks received rules from Argentina's central bank on how the new foreign-exchange market would function about 12 hours before markets opened, and opted to sit out the session. Meanwhile, the financial system has already been struggling to cope with operational complications resulting from the restrictions on cash withdrawals imposed at the start of December and limits on account movements imposed subsequently. Demand for dollars, so far, has been muted because people are short of cash in pesos for buying groceries and paying routine bills. Some economists are forecasting the peso will slump this week to 1.8-2.0 to the dollar as banks become more active in the foreign-exchange market and the government considers reversing recent decisions to slowly lift the bank limits. Leaving the limits on too long is likely to exacerbate a recession already in its fourth year and spark greater social unrest suddenly scrapping them could cause the banking sector to collapse. Late Thursday night, residents of several middle-class neighborhoods took to the streets again to protest further banking restrictions introduced by the administration of President Eduardo Duhalde. Over the weekend, Argentine press reports said the government was considering allowing account holders to access frozen funds to make big-ticket items, such as cars or homes, in order to perk up consumption. The government is also considering providing such special access to pay off credit-card debts and other obligations that cannot be postponed, the reports said.
In the theater, there's sometimes a play within a play. Now Madison Avenue has the plug within a plug. To lower its costs amid the crippling advertising recession, General Electric Co.'s NBC is bringing commercial marketing to a new level by inserting other companies' products into its own promotions for the Winter Olympics. In a new ad campaign to promote the games, for example, NBC has inserted several prominent mentions of the rerelease of the 1982 movie E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial from Vivendi Universal SA's Universal Studios. For viewers, the result is in effect two ads in one, and they see billboards that don't really exist. The ad campaign, which is aimed at drawing young viewers, was created by the network's internal agency. It revolves around a chase scene involving two Olympians, the snowboarder Chris Klug and Cammi Granato, a hockey player who helped the U.S. team win the gold medal at the 1998 games. In the spots, Mr. Klug zooms through a mountain of fresh powder as police and state troopers chase him for speeding. After a pretty girl shows up on the slopes, Mr. Klug crashes through a window into a hockey arena, disrupting a game being played by Ms. Granato, then boards away down the mountain and runs into the pretty girl again. As the police zero in on him, a helicopter appears. Meet me in February in Salt Lake City, Mr. Klug tells the girl as he grabs a rope thrown to him by his helicopter rescue team and is whisked away. Careful viewers are likely to notice a billboard on the mountain plastered with an enormous ad for E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. Halfway through the chase, Mr. Klug slides by another sign for the movie on the side of the ice rink. The technique, called virtual video advertising, is commonly used to project stadium billboards during baseball games, but hasn't been widely used in commercials. It allows advertisers to reach viewers who avoid commercial breaks.
BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine economic team, trying to find its footing following the devaluation of the peso, got a look at neighboring Brazil's playbook yesterday. At the invitation of Argentine colleagues, Brazilian Central Bank Gov. Arminio Fraga visited Buenos Aires yesterday to share the story of how Brazil pulled itself out of a similar financial crisis in 1999. Mr. Fraga met with Argentine Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov to discuss how Brazil managed a significant devaluation of the Brazilian real, which boosted exports, while keeping inflation to single-digit rates. The talks were punctuated by the sound of demonstrators beating drums, chanting and blocking traffic outside government ministries in this bankrupt capital city. Meanwhile, in the far north, gangs of the unemployed broke windows at utility and bank offices. Argentina, after linking its currency 1-1 to the U.S. dollar for a decade, last week devalued the peso by 29 to an official rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar. Since then, the peso has dropped even more on a parallel free market. It closed at 1.85 to the dollar yesterday, down from 1.70 Monday. In the meantime, the new government of President Eduardo Duhalde is scurrying to put together an economic plan that will allow angry Argentines to access bank accounts that have been partially frozen for the past six weeks. Yesterday, Mr. Fraga discussed Brazil's experience in 1999 moving from a fixed to a floating exchange rate and Brazil's experience with inflation targeting, said Thais Heredia, a spokeswoman for Brazil's central bank. Within six months of the devaluation, Mr. Fraga formally implemented a system of using inflation targets to govern interest rates. When prices rise faster than expected, the central bank raises interest rates to cool off the economy.
For the past two years, with the major stock indexes plummeting, investors have searched for places to hide. And they found them in the form of small and middle-size stocks. As the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large stocks was falling more than 15 over the past two years, the S&P's indexes of small stocks and of medium-size stocks were rising more than 15 each. Similarly, when stocks rebounded following the terrorist attacks, small stocks rose 28 and middle-size stocks rose 26, eclipsing the 19 gain put in by large stocks. The Russell 2000 small-stock index finished the full year in the black, up 1, compared with declines at big-stock indexes such as the S&P 500, which fell 13, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 7. But this year, the run has reversed itself, at least for now. Small stocks, which typically get a boost at the start of a new year, have been falling. The Russell 2000 small-stock index, in fact, has been among the year's weaker performers, down 1.9, compared with a drop of 1.3 for the S&P 500. Small-stock fans, who multiplied as the group moved into the lead last year, insist the problem is a temporary, technical one -- essentially a pause after a great finish to 2001. But they also acknowledge that they expect small stocks to cool a bit this year. And some analysts have begun to warn that small stocks, which trailed large stocks for most of the 1990s, may be returning to days when they do no better than big stocks.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Officials at CSX Corp.'s railroad business are accustomed to receiving complaints from customers about poor rail service. But lately they are starting to hear something new praise. They are doing things better, says Craig Huss, vice president of transportation at Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the Decatur, Ill., grain-processing company. After years of service and merger-related problems, the Eastern railroad is taking a different course these days -- running a reliable railroad. Under Michael Ward, who became president of the railroad business CSX Transportation Inc. in 2000, CSX has cleared up its worst service problems and started winning over customers. While still trailing other railroads in overall efficiency, CSX is moving toward running its freight trains on a more precise schedule. It is trying to change the old adversarial railroad culture that created internal friction. And it is winning some freight business away from trucks and securing higher rates from customers for improved rail service. Customers were actually telling us the truth when they said if we gave them more consistent service, they would give us more business and pay us more, Mr. Ward says.
Fox News Channel beat rival 24-hour cable news channel CNN in total viewers for the month of January, the first time the upstart News Corp. channel has attracted more viewers than CNN for a full month in both the prime-time and 24-hour time periods. Fox News has been closing the ratings gap with AOL Time Warner Inc.'s CNN for some time, but this is the first full month that Fox has beaten CNN by both measures. Although January isn't over until Friday, the broadcast industry considers the month over Jan. 27. Fox News averaged 656,000 viewers over a full 24-hour time period in January, an increase of 109 from the prior year, according to Nielsen Media Research. CNN averaged 596,000 viewers, up 51. MSNBC, a joint venture of Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co.'s NBC, averaged 296,000 viewers, up 23. In prime time, Fox News averaged just over one million viewers, compared with 921,000 for CNN and 358,000 for MSNBC. The battle among the cable-news channels is fiercest for 25- to 54-year-olds, since this is the main group advertisers are trying to reach when they buy ads on cable news. Among this group, Fox News averaged 277,000 viewers during the 24-hour period, an increase of 159 CNN averaged 202,000, an increase of 64 and MSNBC averaged 150,000, an increase of 25. Also at issue is the battle to translate ratings into revenue increases during a recession. Industry executives estimate CNN's main domestic channel still enjoys at least double the advertising revenue of either MSNBC or Fox News, reflecting the premiums CNN has built into its rates over time. Executives estimate CNN ad revenue for its main U.S. service at more than 250 million, compared with more than 100 million apiece for MSNBC and Fox News. CNN Headline News also is estimated to pull in more than 100 million in ad revenue.
One day after accounting worries sparked a broad stock selloff, investors regained some of their confidence, bidding stocks up again amid upbeat signals from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index both registered their biggest point and percentage gains of the year. Nearly two billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the most since Sept. 21, shortly after stocks resumed trading following the terrorist attacks. After falling 2.51 on Tuesday, the Dow industrials rebounded 1.50, or 144.62 points, to 9762.86, after the Fed said that the outlook for recovery has become more promising. The broad S&P 500 rose 1.17, or 12.93 points, to 1113.57, while the Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by large technology stocks, rose rose 20.45 points, or 1.08, to 1913.44. The Fed ended its two-day policy meeting by leaving its target interest rates unchanged for the first time since it began making a series of 11 rate cuts more than a year ago. Investors were encouraged that the Fed felt it was safe to stop stimulating the economy, and were heartened by the central bank's suggestion that the nation's painful economic downturn may be ending. Many traders, however, attributed the market rebound to an announcement by Tyco International, which has been hammered in recent days on complaints that its accounts are hard to understand, that its chairman and chief financial officer would buy some Tyco stock.
Fifty years ago Wednesday, a 25-year-old woman was awakened in a hunting lodge -- a posh treehouse, actually -- in Kenya and told that her father had died. Therefore she was immediately Elizabeth II, sovereign. Tony Blair, the 10th prime minister of Elizabeth II's reign, was not yet born when she ascended to the throne. Winston Churchill was then the first among her ministers. How much has changed since her June 1953 coronation The decision to televise it was deeply controversial. Most television sets were in pubs, where, it was feared, decorum among the lower orders might lapse during the ceremony. Since then, the House of Windsor, including some of its much-too- merry wives, has often resembled a soap opera. But, then, sovereignty has never been a shield from life's vicissitudes The longest- surviving child of Queen Anne's 1702-14 18 pregnancies died at age 11. Elizabeth II's coronation coincided with Edmund Hillary's conquest of Everest and, almost as inspiriting, with the end of tea rationing, a relic of the war, which stirred hopes of a New Elizabethan Age. Instead, there was the continuing loss of empire, a diminishing world role, watery socialism and worsening economic anemia. By the mid-1970s Britain was reduced to the status of the sick man of Europe. Then came revival, but the woman who authored it was named not Elizabeth but Margaret -- Thatcher. Once upon a time, in mankind's political immaturity, monarchy was the best available answer to the problems of sovereignty and succession as nation-states evolved. And being a monarch was risky. Richard III 1483-85 was the last English king to die in battle and George II 1727-60 was the last to fight alongside British troops.
President Bush warned Congress and the nation that the country will long remain vulnerable to terrorism, as he pledged to devote the second year of his presidency to combating the recession at home and enemies abroad. In his first State of the Union address, Bush laid out a justification for a longer and broader war against terrorism that would expand into a campaign to encourage education and democratic values in the Islamic world. The president portrayed the threat in stark terms, disclosing that U.S. forces in Afghanistan have found diagrams of U.S. nuclear power plants and that tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. And he said hostile nations, including North Korea, Iraq and Iran, represent an axis of evil that is attempting to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Seeking support for the largest increase in defense spending in 20 years, Bush said The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons. Bush also outlined his strategy for prodding the United States back to prosperity. He said he would strive to create new opportunities for work, cushion the impact of unemployment, and foster a new ethic of volunteerism within communities.
NEW YORK -- To some outside observers, U.S. consumers and corporations appear to have gorged themselves on debt. Yet neither sector of the economy seems to be crumbling as a result. Among bond-market participants, there is a growing perception, reflected by price action in different fixed-income sectors, that so long as borrowers have obtained cheap financing in a climate of low interest rates, they can stomach a hefty amount of debt. Treasury bonds, which have performed well during the U.S. economic downturn, are starting to wilt, while corporate bonds stand to do better if the U.S. economy improves, as expected in 2002. Even those Treasury-market strategists who had been consistently warning about an impending meltdown of consumer spending are changing their tune in light of stronger economic reports in the past month. If there was going to be a day of reckoning for the consumer, I would have thought it would have happened by now, said Mary Ann Hurley, senior Treasurys trader in Seattle for brokerage D.A. Davidson. Consumers account for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Ms. Hurley sees selective opportunities in riskier corporate bonds whose valuations benefit as consumer spending gears up.
Limited Inc., reversing a seven-year-old decision to separate Intimate Brands Inc., said it is offering nearly 1.5 billion in stock to buy back the 16 it doesn't already own in the company. Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, offered part of Intimate Brands, parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, to the public in 1995 in a move designed to highlight the value of the businesses. At the time, Intimate Brands accounted for 70 of Limited's operating income but less than 60 of the company's stock-market valuation. Today, the two measures are more in line. Limited gets more than 90 of its operating income from Intimate Brands and about 95 of its market capitalization. The most significant factor in the Board's decision to take this action is the belief that a recombination of the businesses at this point will allow us to achieve greater growth, Leslie Wexner, chief executive of both companies, said in a statement. This clearer, simpler structure will allow us to fully develop the potential of our best brands across merchandise categories and distribution channels. Under terms of the proposal, Limited is offering 1.046 Limited shares for each Class A share of Intimate Brands. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Limited were down 70 cents at 17.75, while Intimate Brands slipped 40 cents to 17.50. The exchange offer values Intimate Brands at 18.57 a share, only a 6.1 premium to Intimate's current trading price. Intimate Brands hit a 52-week-high of 19 about one year ago today. The stock price of Limited, whose brands include Limited stores, Express, Structure and Lerner New York, closely tracks that of Intimate Brands.
In a high-stakes race to bring a new type of cancer drug to market, two companies have gained important ground after the leading company, ImClone Systems Inc., failed to clear regulatory hurdles. To get to the market quickly, ImClone tried a high-risk strategy to seek regulatory approval with one small, unusually designed clinical trial. But the Food and Drug Administration in December refused to review its application. The resulting mess -- a rash of shareholder lawsuits, embarrassing publicity, and investigations by Congress and regulators -- has been a nightmare for ImClone and its officers and directors. But ImClone's stumble may have created an unexpected opportunity for AstraZeneca PLC and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the multibillion-dollar market for this new class of cancer drugs. AstraZeneca may now lead the pack On the very day ImClone announced the FDA's decision, Dec. 28, AstraZeneca said it had completed its application with the agency for its drug. Whoever is on the market first will dominate for a long period of time, says oncologist Eric Rowinsky, director of clinical research at the Institute for Drug Development in San Antonio, where he has run clinical trials on five rival drugs to ImClone's drug, Erbitux. Eagerly anticipated by oncologists and patients, ImClone's treatment was expected to be the first of a new class of drugs that tries to stop cancer from spreading by interfering with the chemical signals -- most notably the activation of substances on the outside of cells called epidermal growth factor receptors -- that seem to tell cells to proliferate. Most solid-tumor cancers -- colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and head-and-neck -- appear to grow using the chemical signaling the medicines aim to block. Although each of the new drugs might be approved initially for different types of tumors, they are expected to compete because oncologists routinely use drugs on many types of cancers besides the approved ones.

From coast to coast, governors are tiptoeing around gaping deficits in state budgets. They have appeared suddenly, like sinkholes in tapped-out oil fields 12.5 billion in California, 1.4 billion in Michigan, 533 million in Kentucky. These shortfalls are small by federal standards. But unlike the government in Washington, state governments must balance their budgets every year Virtually all are forbidden, by law or constitution, from running deficits. As a result, 40 states must close a collective 40 billion in deficits for fiscal 2002, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. But this being an election year, the story doesn't end there. From Hartford to Sacramento, these gaps are generating significant political tension. Virtually every state chief executive has ruled out the most potent revenue-raising weapon in his or her arsenal income tax increases. And that's a mistake. Governors are turning their backs on the most ready source of revenues -- as well as the fairest and most painless way of raising funds. It wasn't always this way. During the last recession, in the early 1990s, governors and big city mayors faced much the same challenge. Many of them, Democrats and Republicans alike, took what seemed to be the easy route. They simply cut spending and pushed through income tax hikes. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton pursued essentially the same strategy, boosting marginal income tax rates on the highest-earning Americans. But while the income tax increases of a decade ago proved to be solid fiscal successes, they were abject political failures. And as a result, today's governors treat income tax increases the way members of the Texas congressional delegation treat Enron. They shudder even to mention the powerful force that until recently provided them with immense benefits even though, from a fiscal perspective, it makes the most sense to tax the richest vein of revenues. Never mind the hoary debate over regressive sales taxes and progressive taxes on income. Raising taxes on income simply doesn't enter the vocabulary of today's governors, regardless of their party. Instead, today's fiscally challenged governors are earnestly pledging to cut spending, commandeering funds from the tobacco settlement, and placing big bets on two fiscal long-shots a swift economic recovery and increased federal aid. Those who are raising revenues are embracing less politically painful -- and likely less effective -- taxes on cigarettes, telephones, sales and services.
CORRECTION The Washington Investing column in the Feb. 11 Business section incorrectly reported the status of Ernst & Young's consulting practice. Ernst & Young sold its global management and information technology consulting practice in May 2000. Published 21202 Last week, the big accounting firms all said that having seen the light of Enron, they will somehow segregate their accounting and consulting operations. The consulting conflict is obviously not the only thing that's wrong with corporate accounting, but building a barrier between auditing and consulting or splitting them into separate companies is a good start. Cutting apart the two businesses, as the accounting firms well know, will be radical surgery, requiring the companies to fundamentally change the way they manage, operate and market their services. The separation anxiety will be greatest at Ernst & Young, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The need for the split was recognized years ago by KPMG and what was then known as Arthur Andersen.
In the wake of Sept. 11, rich countries are being exhorted to spend more money on foreign aid. If income inequality has spawned terrorist movements, the thinking goes, then rich countries should shell out more to make the world safer. But enormous sums of aid for development have already been wasted over past decades. And different countries have different needs Afghanistan's request for peacekeeping forces is a far cry from Argentina's entreaty for a financial bailout. Easy as it might be to succumb to the cheap grace of writing checks, the Bush administration is proposing a more thoughtful approach to foreign aid. Its goals, to emphasize quality over quantity and to focus on measurable results, will no doubt antagonize the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, who prefer to help the world by soliciting more funds for their own budgets. Under the Bush plan, recipient nations will be asked to assume greater responsibility for their own economic decisions. Call it the tough love approach to global development. One of the first steps is recognizing that economic growth must begin in the soil of basic security and the rule of law. In countries besieged by war and political instability, few have the luxury of focusing on improving their own prospects. I receive daily delegations from all over Afghanistan, notes Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai. They all ask for security and peace more than education, health and development. Financial assistance that fights crime and promotes a functioning legal system is money well spent. But it can only succeed where a nation is committed to transparency and good governance. Helping improve nations' productivity is another area where foreign assistance can help. Access to health care and education allows individuals to become contributors to the global economy rather than be left behind or remain perpetual burdens. Enrolling girls in school can literally double the potential work force. Likewise, money to provide vaccinations against infectious diseases or prevent the spread of AIDS not only relieves human misery, but changes the social and economic dynamics of stricken nations. In South Africa, the AIDS tax the epidemic's cost on business is as high as 10 per year. Still, as nice as it all sounds, humanitarian aid to improve peoples' lives and give them the chance to be productive is an empty victory without opportunities for nations to capture the rewards of upgraded skills and lift themselves out of poverty. And much of that responsibility falls to local governments. No one is indifferent to scenes of desperate people in Argentina being injured or killed in riots caused by money meltdown and financial chaos. But as Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill points out, Argentine officials received some 60 billion in emergency assistance from the IMF and other sources, yet they just didn't reform. It is irresponsible to continue giving money to a government that violates the most basic commitment to its citizens.
Oddsmakers give the recession a short duration. Even dour Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has detected a few signs of early recovery. But not everyone is yet convinced. Clearly, stock and bond investors have hedged their bets All the averages are way below their optimistic thresholds. The bankruptcies of Enron, Kmart, Global Crossing and others have cast serious doubt about the sustainability of recovery. And lingering in the background is always the threat of another terrorist attack, Mideast war, or Third World currency collapse. As Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and later chief economist for the World Bank, warned way back in November, this recession might turn out to be the worst in 20 years. As Professor Stiglitz sees it, a deep recession like 1981-82 is the best we can hope for. In that 16-month recession, output fell by 12.3 and unemployment soared to a post-war high of 10.8. By contrast, in the 1990-91 recession, output fell only 2.3 and unemployment peaked at 6.5. That is the kind of short, shallow recession the optimists are hoping for this time around. Despite the spate of warning signs, the optimistic outlook still remains strong. The optimists' case rests not only on the usual array of indicators -- rising consumer confidence, abnormally low inventories, cheap money, and fiscal stimulus -- but also on a wild card few observers have noticed.
LINTHICUM, Md. -- Ciena Corp. agreed to acquire ONI Systems Corp. in an 850 million stock deal, creating a powerhouse in optical-networking equipment and possibly sparking further industry consolidation. Hugh Martin, ONI's chairman, president and chief executive, said the companies are a perfect match, since Ciena specializes in equipment for long-haul networks while ONI provides gear for metropolitan networks. Mr. Martin said he initiated the deal, partly because ONI's telecommunications-carrier customers had expressed some concern about breadth of product line and customer support from ONI as a stand-alone company. Although Ciena has increased its market share over the past year, the Linthicum, Md., company -- like its competitors -- has been hit hard by plummeting demand for networking gear, as telecommunications carriers rein in spending or struggle to stay in business. Ciena recently warned of sharply falling revenue and a substantial loss for its fiscal first quarter, ended Jan. 31. Ciena's top competitors include Nortel Networks Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Alcatel SA and others. Demand for metropolitan network equipment, however, is holding up much better than the long-haul network segment, said Gary Smith, Ciena's president and chief executive. The combination of the companies' product lines stands to be compelling from a customer point of view, he said.
Northern Virginia Republicans in the House of Delegates rallied support today for a local income tax to fund school construction in their region, an option they view as a prime source of money now that the House speaker is poised to kill a Senate bill for statewide education assistance. With House Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr. R-Amherst planning the demise of the statewide bill on Monday, GOP delegates from Northern Virginia scrambled to line up support for a replacement bill for education improvements back home -- and to fund them through a new income tax that would require the approval of local county boards. I'm working my darnedest to see what I can do, said Del. Jeannemarie A. Devolites Fairfax, who was taking the lead role of rounding up votes for the income tax measure. This is the better way to go It would keep every dollar raised at home. After winning Wilkins's permission in a 9 a.m. meeting, Devolites and other suburban Republicans spent the day trying out the income tax concept on colleagues. Devolites, one of Wilkins's lieutenants on the House floor, said the reception was mixed. Some rural Republicans complained that without the Senate bill, school systems in their districts stood to win no new money at all. Wilkins and Gov. Mark R. Warner D have been sparring for several days over Senate Bill 170, sponsored by Democrat Charles J. Colgan of Prince William County, which would place two issues affecting Northern Virginia on the Nov. 5 election ballot. One would be a statewide referendum to raise the state's 4.5 percent sales tax by a half-cent to fund education programs the other, for Northern Virginia only, would raise the sales tax locally by the same amount and earmark the proceeds for regional transportation projects.
President Bush today will propose a revision of the landmark 1996 law that overhauled the welfare system, by increasing work requirements on people who get government assistance, while giving states new subsidies to encourage marriage and continuing a ban on welfare payments to immigrants, administration officials said yesterday. Bush's plan, to be announced at a Washington Catholic church, would increase the percentage of welfare recipients required to have jobs or take part in related activities by 5 percent a year, raising it from 50 percent to 70 percent. The plan would require a 40-hour workweek, instead of 30, with accommodations for parents with infants or other special circumstances. As a concession to governors and congressional Democrats, the plan would let states count 16 hours of education or other job preparation toward the 40 hours of required work. I think work ought to be the core of welfare reform, Bush told a meeting of governors at the White House yesterday. In order to make sure that welfare reform works, that there's flexibility at the states, that there's recognition people need training or drug rehabilitation. But work ought to be the centerpiece of a good welfare law. In highlights of the plan released by the administration last evening, the White House made clear for the first time that it does not intend to restore the ban on welfare benefits for immigrants who entered the country legally after 1996. Those immigrants were one of the main groups that lost benefits under the welfare law six years ago. Democrats are joining welfare rights groups and immigrant advocates in urging that those benefits be restored. A White House document labels its decision on that issue, Safeguarding Against Welfare Dependency Among Non-Citizens. As Bush aides have previously said, the plan calls for legal immigrants to receive food stamps five years after entering the United States.
Alan Greenspan had upbeat words for investors, but not upbeat enough to sustain much of a stock rally. After being up as much as 1.38, or 139.98 points in the morning, while Mr. Greenspan was speaking to the House Financial Services Committee, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up only 0.12, or 12.32 points, at 10127.58. In his comments, the Federal Reserve chairman said he sees increasing signs that the nation's recession is ending, though he cautioned that any recovery this year is likely to be mild. Some traders said a turning point for stocks was the midday announcement from Wachovia Securities that it was cutting earnings forecasts for Cisco Systems, which finished the day down 8 on the news. Cisco isn't a component of the Dow industrials, but it is an influential part of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is dominated by large technology companies. After being up as much as 1.52 early in the day, the Nasdaq composite turned down sharply after the Wachovia announcement, finishing down 0.85, or 14.98 points, at 1751.88. Stock investors also were disappointed that Mr. Greenspan didn't see a stronger economy, and some decided to cash in their recent profits.
When President Richard M. Nixon's ambassador to France got roaring drunk and began groping the flight attendants on a trip home from Paris, Nixon didn't see that much to get excited about. Look, people get drunk, the president said after a Jack Anderson column regaled readers with a graphic account of Ambassador Arthur K. Watson's behavior on a March 1972 flight to Washington. People chase girls. And the point is, it's a hell of a lot better for them to get drunk than to take drugs. It's better to chase girls than boys. Now that's my position and let's stop this crap, Nixon declared at a March 14, 1972, Oval Office meeting with his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. Understand The episode, which prompted Democratic congressional demands for an investigation and Watson's resignation, is one of thousands chronicled on 426 hours of White House tapes released yesterday, the biggest release to date. The new batch deals with the tumultuous first half of 1972, which included Nixon's historic trip to China, a fierce battle for the Democratic presidential nomination and an assassination attempt that crippled Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace at the height of his popularity. It also included what the White House sought to dismiss as a third-rate burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex. At one point, in a discussion with national security adviser Henry A. Kissinger about intensified bombing of North Vietnam, Nixon abruptly suggested a nuclear strike. But he may have just been trying to get a rise out of Kissinger, who quickly played down the idea.
Express commuter buses, new routes in areas hungry for transit, and high-tech devices to allow buses to zip past cars were among the initial recommendations offered yesterday by consultants working on a 2 million bus study for Metro. The study, the first comprehensive analysis of the region's bus system in 30 years, began two years ago and is focused on Metrobus as well as more local bus service, such as Ride On and Fairfax Connector. One of our goals is to improve the bus image, to make people want to ride it, said Rick Stevens, Metro's director of business planning and development. That means improving reliability, enhancing amenities so you're not standing in the rain waiting for your bus. . . . This is about making it a premium service, like rail. The study analyzed existing service, relying on a raft of data, including a customer survey of 40,000 riders and a telephone survey of 1,000 riders. It found good service and coverage on weekdays but crowding on many District routes and poor productivity -- meaning few riders -- on some suburban routes, said Larry Englisher, of MultiSystems Inc., a consultant to Metro. Increasing frequency, extending evening and weekend service, improving feeder service to subway stations and reducing crowding on District buses were among the ideas Englisher presented to Metro directors yesterday.
People say that global poverty's a shame, but there's just no way to fix it. People say they'd welcome bigger aid programs, but aid is mostly wasted. Here is why these pessimists are utterly mistaken. The doomsters say that pro-market policy reforms, supported by aid donors and especially by the World Bank, have been a failure. But two decades of reform have actually succeeded. Since 1980 the number of people living on less than 1 a day has fallen by about 200 million, even as the world's population has risen by 1.6 billion. That is a stunning achievement given that the ranks of the poor previously had swollen steadily at least since 1820. The doomsters say that however much you throw aid at schools or health clinics, you never see much progress. But the adult illiteracy rate in the poor world has halved during the past three decades, and life expectancy has grown by 20 years during the past four. Again, a stunning achievement. The previous 20-year jump in longevity had taken since the Stone Age. The doomsters say that even if some developing countries did well, there's no evidence that aid was the reason. But economists can measure aid's role by analyzing aid levels, growth rates and other variables across countries. The World Bank calculates that 1 billion in extra aid lifts more than 250,000 people above the 1-a-day line. The doomsters say that even if aid has some effect, it's unproductive by the standards of advanced economies. Well, the World Bank's private-sector arm, which lends to businesses in the developing world, reports that the median project in its portfolio between 1998 and 2000 earned a post-tax return on capital of 10 percent. That compares well with the productivity of many multinational companies. At Alcoa, for example, the post-tax return on capital has averaged 9.6 percent during the past half-decade.

John Turner wonders about people who complain that student grades today are inflated. His small rural school in east Texas gave him A's for doing very little, he says, while his son Stephen, a junior at Langley High in Fairfax County, has to master math and chemistry at the level I had in my freshman year at Rice University. Wanda Radowitz feels the same way. Her ninth-grade daughter at Georgetown Day School in the District has been writing research papers with bibliographies and footnotes since the fourth grade. When Radowitz was in high school, she spent her study time doing her hair, listening to the Beatles and reading CliffsNotes to get B's. Now her daughter and friends form study groups to review French verb tenses or to discuss themes and characterization in 'The Odyssey.'  Most experts agree that colleges have let grading standards slip, but many teachers and parents believe that it's tougher to get a good grade in high school these days -- and a new study seems to back them up. After examining mathematics grades and standardized test scores of 23,900 high school students, researchers for the Santa Monica, Calif.- based Rand Corp. found no large-scale, substantial grade inflation, at least in mathematics, between 1982 and 1992. Better measures and models could lead to somewhat different estimates, but it seems unlikely that they would lead to a dramatically different finding, researchers Daniel M. Koretz and Mark Berends said in the report commissioned by the College Board. The researchers even saw hints of possible grade deflation, in that 1992 students received slightly lower grades than 1982 students with the same test scores. Koretz and Berends said there was no way to tell whether the courses are actually harder or easier than they used to be.
Mortgage Rates and Weather Give a Boost Existing-home sales increased briskly in most regions in the fourth quarter of 2001, even compared with strong sales a year earlier, thanks to low mortgage rates for buyers and unseasonably warm weather for builders. East South Central and Great Lakes states showed the biggest gains as their stabilizing manufacturing sectors prompted workers to go ahead with delayed home-buying plans. Similarly, sales in Rocky Mountain states were boosted by workers' confidence in some of their dominant industries, such as New Mexico's defense contractors. But sales were sluggish at best in economies more tied to the information-technology sector, notably Pacific and New England states that were overbuilt with expensive homes prior to the industry's meltdown in 2000. The good news there Some prices are down, making some of the nation's highest-priced markets more affordable. --- Percentage change from year earlier in existing-home sales 4th Qtr. 2001 vs. 4th Qtr. 2000
Stocks pulled back and Treasury bonds plummeted after Alan Greenspan sparked fears of an interest-rate increase with an unexpectedly upbeat speech. The stock decline was mild, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.46, or 48.92 points, to 10525.37. The pullback probably had more to do with profit-taking after a big run-up than with anything the Federal Reserve chairman said to the Senate Banking Committee. But bonds fell sharply, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to a level it hasn't seen for eight months. The reaction appeared to be a direct result of Mr. Greenspan rewriting the speech he had delivered last week to the House Financial Services Committee. Last week, Mr. Greenspan said simply that the recession seemed to be bottoming out. Yesterday, he made several revisions, saying that an economic expansion is already well under way. Some bond investors took that as a signal that the Fed could move to control the economic expansion by raising its target interest rates as soon as the second half of the year. The fact that his first speech was so dovish and his second speech changed over the course of just a few days really took the market by surprise, said Scott Gewirtz, head of U.S. Treasury trading at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. Mr. Gewirtz said futures prices now suggest that the Fed is going to raise interest rates about two percentage points over the next year.
By some measures, the maker of the popular video game State of Emergency has one of its own. Take-Two Interactive Software last month restated earnings downward for seven consecutive fiscal quarters, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its accounting practices and announced its chief financial officer's resignation after two months on the job for personal reasons. A little later, the New York company, which makes video games, said there was an error in a portion of its restated earnings. The reaction from Wall Street Numerous analysts praised the company, and investors have bid up its stock 8 since Take-Two made its announcement. An anomaly in a market that supposedly is more attentive to accounting issues in the wake of the alleged accounting irregularities at collapsed Enron Not really. Take Hanover Compressor, a company with similar problems. It said last month that it, too, would restate lower seven quarters of earnings, that the SEC is reviewing its accounting for a partnership, and that it also had appointed a new chief financial officer. But the company's stock has soared 27 since breaking the news. Moreover, although the company recently lowered 2002 financial targets, analysts have become even more bullish about the stock.
At the core of Marion Barry's quest for political revival are true believers like Benjy Little. In Barry's four terms as mayor, he funded Little's recreation center, employed his parents and gave him a series of summer jobs. I call him my father, said Little, 30, of Anacostia, who survived a bout of drug addiction to become a school mediation counselor and start a small music magazine. Marion Barry is the only person I had. But more than 20 years after Barry first rose to power, Washington has fewer and fewer Benjy Littles, with direct personal and economic ties to the political machine Barry built as the dominant power in city politics over decades. As Barry mounts his latest comeback attempt, he faces a city that is wealthier and whiter -- and a government that is less devoted to political patronage -- than it was in his heyday. And much of his traditional constituency has moved to what Washingtonians jokingly call Ward 9 -- Prince George's County. That Barry is still regarded as a formidable force is testimony to the enduring power of his politics. They are populist and personal, giving him a fighting chance to overcome demographics and voting patterns that are shifting against him.
In her Feb. 19 front-page article, HUD Loses Faith in Housing Program, Carol D. Leonnig misstated and omitted facts. In six months, the Church Association for Community Service renovated and sold 21 homes with happy homeowners. More than 80 percent of these homes were sold to low- to moderate-income families at affordable prices. Despite the efforts of midlevel Housing and Urban Devlopment officials, the Bush administration looked beyond partisan politics, saw the merits of the project and allowed it to move forward. Otherwise, 21 new homeowners and 14 soon-to-be homeowners would not own a home, and there would be 300 boarded-up houses in Washington instead of 265. This project is proof that faith-based solutions do work. Also, we applaud D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams's support for affordable housing, including this project. Ms. Leonnig misstated information on the fees earned by our company and by the Church Association. GLM will be paid only its costs plus a 10 percent fee. GLM has yet to recover its costs, and the Church Association has poured all of the money back into the project. We are the only African American and self-sustained Asset Control Area Agreement operating with HUD. Also, we are the most cost- effective agreement others received sizable grants. We hope race is not the issue here, but we wonder. Ultimately, we rest our case on results -- 21 sold and 14 under contract -- completed in six months. The Post articles on District community development corporations front page, Feb. 24 and 25 overlooked the tremendous contributions that CDCs have made to neighborhoods that others, including the private sector, had long since written off.
Lockheed Martin Corp. has reached a tentative contract agreement with workers at two of three factories that had threatened to strike, but the local union at the company's plant in Marietta, Ga., recommended rejecting the settlement offer. Union officials at two plants in California -- an airplane development center in Palmdale and a missiles and space facility in Sunnyvale -- have expressed support for the package. The company's final offer was announced yesterday after nearly 36 hours of negotiations with the aid of federal mediators. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at all three of the plants are to vote on the offer Sunday. Earlier this week, about 6,000 of the workers voted to strike on Monday if there was no agreement. Strikes now appear unlikely in California, but Jim Carroll, president of the union's Local 709 in Marietta, said the contract for the Georgia workers contains different language. Among other concerns, Carroll said the proposed contract would let Lockheed Martin outsource work now being done by employees. Outsourcing and job security have been particular concerns in Marietta, where the company builds the F-22 fighter jet and the C- 130J military transport -- aircraft with relatively high price tags and low production runs. The local union's membership has dropped from 7,000 workers in 1990 to about 2,700 now.
An 800-page compendium of charts, factoids, images and essays, it was produced by Harvard graduate students under the wing of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. The academics sought to document how shopping became the engine of 20th-century urban growth. They contend shopping is now the defining activity of public life. We shop at the airport, we shop at church. The train station is now a mall. McDonald's is also a toy store. Former military bases are being reconditioned as theme parks with shopping malls. We can buy embryos at the hospital. Museums make more money from their shops than from any other single source. And we are happy to treat ourselves to cultured gift wrap. Urbanization is commerce. Few consumers would deny that their lives -- and the local landscape -- have been affected by mall sprawl, Big Box empires, entertainment zones and outlet villages. The real-life mystery is why so many serious architects didn't involve themselves at every step in their creation. Koolhaas, of course, is the Pritzker Prize-winning creator of such high-profile design ventures as the Guggenheim Las Vegas and Prada's SoHo boutique. As an architect and thinker, he has long sought to meld high and low culture. The shopping project met that test Koolhaas turned Harvard's elite into mall rats. More than a dozen master's degree candidates fanned out over three continents to conduct field research, gather statistics and compile histories and anecdotal evidence. Their data, gathered during the 1997-1998 school year, have been reproduced on hefty stock and published by Taschen. The launch itself was an adventure in high-low culture The guide was introduced in Europe with a tony event at London's Tate Modern. Last week New Yorkers were invited to a Chinatown restaurant.
While the U.S. economy bounced back in the fourth quarter, Europe's own gross domestic product shrank for the first time since 1993, according to the chief European statistics agency. Still, evidence is mounting that a recovery on the Continent is under way. Among the 12 countries that share the euro, GDP, the total value of goods and services, contracted by 0.2 in the fourth quarter from the third, Eurostat reported. Growth was dragged down by corporate retrenchment in the face of slackening global demand. But just as it followed the U.S. in its downturn, Europe appears to be moving upward now as well. Surveys show that Europe's overall economic mood, as measured by the European Economic Sentiment Indicator, is now at its best since September, and inflation is on the whole falling. Spaniards are building. Italians are using more phone services and burning more electricity. The French keep buying. Lufthansa, the German airline, recently lifted a hiring freeze on cabin and ground crew as it prepares for more flights to the U.S. this summer. Indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions, Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, said last week. In its latest growth forecasts, the European Commission agreed. The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1 and 0.4, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4 to 0.7 next quarter. These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate, the commission said in a statement. There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies.
James Tobin, 84, a Yale University economics professor who won the 1981 Nobel Prize in economics for his analysis of investments and financial markets known as portfolio selection theory, died March 11 at a hospital in New Haven, Conn., after a stroke. Dr. Tobin, who was said to have been among the most influential and creative economists of his time, served on the Council of Economic Advisers in John F. Kennedy's administration. He was a major contributor to theories of investment, consumption, money and banking and economic growth, and he was widely known in academia and business as a leading apostle of the economic thinking of British economist John Maynard Keynes that tax and budget policies can be used effectively to regulate an economy. As a Keynesian economist, Dr. Tobin feuded with monetarists who argue that controlling the supply of money and credit is the best way to regulate an economy. His sharp attacks on Milton Friedman, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics and widely recognized as the dean of monetarists, were particularly well publicized, as were his criticisms in the early 1980s of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Volcker's single-minded effort to curb inflation with tough monetary policy, Dr. Tobin told a congressional subcommittee, was likely to result in damage to the real economy in terms of unemployment, low production, recession, low investment and so on. Economics, Dr. Tobin once told a meeting of the American Economic Association, inevitably blends ideology and science. Describing the portfolio selection theory that helped him win a Nobel Prize, he said it sets forth the principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket because then, if something goes wrong, you lose them all at once. This theory was said to have been influential in the willingness of investors to diversify holdings. Hobart Rowen, the late Washington Post business editor, wrote that Tobin's work for the first time showed the relationship of financial assets to the development of government financial policy.
He was elected in 2000 and began serving just 14 months ago, so he has not yet absorbed the lesson that in Washington, symbolism is far more important than substance. Even though he served an apprenticeship in the House of Representatives more than a decade ago, his eight years as the Democratic governor of Delaware ruined him. Carper, like other governors of both parties, became accustomed to being judged on the results he produced for his state, not on his rhetoric. That is why he was able to defeat a popular incumbent, William Roth, in their gentlemanly Senate election campaign. And it is why he looked at the so-called stimulus bill that whisked through Congress last week and was signed by President Bush on Saturday with such a skeptical eye that he was one of only 12 legislators in the entire House and Senate to vote no. He explained to his constituents that he could not be part of the game when Congress passed a bill that spends money we don't have to fight a recession that is already over. Four hundred and seventeen representatives -- all but three of those who voted -- and 85 of the 94 voting senators disagreed, and many of them spent the past weekend at home, bragging about the help they delivered. The new law extends unemployment benefits in most states an additional 13 weeks, provides rapid tax depreciation as an inducement for business investment, funnels aid into the New York City area hit by terrorists last Sept. 11 and keeps in place a few random tax provisions that otherwise would have expired.
It is possible to view the indictment of Arthur Andersen as the simple story of a few rogue document-shredders in the firm's Houston office, or an act in the larger Enron drama, or a turning point in a morality play at one of the world's great accounting firms. There are those here in Washington who see it as the first of a five-part series on the corruption of the accounting profession. But in the broadest sense, Andersen may be seen as just one tragic character in the boom-and-bust saga of the 1990s -- a victim as much as a protagonist in the unfolding drama of cheap capital, fast fortunes and stock-price addiction. It is the story not just of Andersen and Enron but Global Crossing and MicroStrategy, WorldCom and Qwest, the dot-com bust and the two-year bear market and even the global recession. In Andersen's case, the path toward criminal indictment began on Wall Street, which by the mid-1990s was awash in money looking to be profitably invested A surge in retirement savings of baby boomers a tidal wave of investment capital from overseas investors unimpressed with opportunities at home hordes of cash generated by newly efficient and profitable U.S. corporations. In time, this excess supply drove stock and bond prices through the roof, encouraging companies to rush out with new offerings to soak up the billions of dollars. And with their inflated shares, companies found they had a sought-after currency with which to buy other companies, secure loans, pay back creditors and compensate employees. In time, the stock-fueled demand drove up the price of everything from Park Avenue condos to the wages of hamburger flippers at McDonald's. For Andersen, Wall Street's boom presented both challenge and opportunity. In attracting and retaining key professionals, firms like Andersen compete with investment banks, consulting and law firms and large corporations. And by the late 1990s, the compensation for this talent was soaring. MBAs right out of the best business schools could command six-figure packages while top partners came to believe they deserved nothing less than seven.
Every weekday at the Erie Neighborhood House on this city's North Side, feisty 4- and 5-year-olds file into classrooms that bear names such as Sunflower and Daffodil to play with Legos and dinosaurs and receive their daily lessons in Spanish and English. Their parents, depending on the family income, pay as little as 4.33 a month for the all-day child care that costs as much as 250 a week on the open market, an enormous sum for the many who are recent immigrants working two or three jobs to survive. But the sounds of children playing and learning in these classrooms may soon be silenced as part of a belt-tightening proposal by Gov. George Ryan R that would do away with a 184 million early childhood grant that subsidizes pre-kindergarten classes for 220,000 low-income children around the state. Illinois, like nearly every other state, is facing lean times for the first time in years. Tax revenue is well below expectations, the cost of health care is exploding and higher costs for unemployment claims and new security initiatives are taxing already thin budgets. Everything is on the table -- including tax incentives for businesses, public education money and programs aimed at the poor, disabled and elderly -- as governors and state lawmakers try to make up more than 40 billion worth of budget shortfalls. In Maryland, the state Senate yesterday gave preliminary approval to a new austerity budget that would slow spending after years of dramatic increases while preserving a scheduled 2 percent income tax cut. Virginia, with an annual budget of about 25 billion, approved new spending plans last week that cut social programs and other services while increasing fees and college tuitions to close a budget gap estimated at 3.8 billion for the next 2 12 years.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mostly higher after being whipsawed both before and after the Federal Reserve said it was leaving interest rates unchanged, while shifting to a more balanced view of the risks facing the economy. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 432 point, or 1.25 per 1,000 face value, at 96 2932. Its yield fell to 5.279 from 5.296 Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year Treasury bond, the weakest maturity, was unchanged from Monday at 95 132 to yield 5.728. Treasurys had been lower for most of the session. But the market rallied after the Fed's decision to keep the federal-funds rate at 1.75 was announced at 219 p.m. EST. In a statement, the central bank said that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects of both goals. But the Fed also sounded a note of caution about future activity, mentioning that the outlook for final demand -- seen as the linchpin for a sustainable recovery -- remains unclear.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new high for the year following a generally upbeat assessment from the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates unchanged. The Fed signaled that the prospects for the economy are improving, helping to keep stocks up across the board even though the rate decision was anticipated. Many investors said they were relieved the Fed didn't signal excessive nervousness about inflation, though it did give one of its first indications that it might raise interest rates later this year if the economic turnaround continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.54, or 57.50 points, at 10635.25. That's just above the previous high for the year, hit a week ago, of 10632.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 0.41, or 4.74 points to 1170.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.20, or 3.81 points, to 1880.87. Bond prices edged higher and the dollar was up. Stocks dropped slightly after the Fed's announcement at 220 p.m. EST but managed to fend off afternoon selling pressure and close in positive territory.
Federal Reserve officials left their interest rate target unchanged at a meeting yesterday and signaled that they may be in no rush to raise rates as long as the economic outlook remains uncertain. The central bank's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, said the economy is expanding at a significant pace but then noted that the rate of growth later this year is still uncertain. The burst of strong economic data in recent weeks caused the FOMC to shift its assessment of the risks facing the economy. At the committee's last meeting, in late January, it had concluded that the risk of further economic weakness outweighed that of added inflation. Yesterday, however, the officials said they believe risks to their long-run goals of price stability and sustained economic expansion are now balanced. This shift is a first small step in the direction of raising the FOMC's 1.75 percent target for overnight rates later this year -- assuming the rebound from last year's recession does not falter significantly. Many investors and analysts believe the first rate hike will come at the next FOMC meeting on May 7.
Washington -- Contrary to popular belief, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is capable of speaking clearly. A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing. A striking feature of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business. Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve pricing power in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare service providers without global competition universities that raise tuition hospitals jacking up fees or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15 since mid-2000. But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy. Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course What happens if industries shutter excess factories around the world or if inventories are trimmed What happens to prices if industries become more concentrated oligopolies
The new federal long-term care insurance program features three prepackaged benefit plans but also allows government employees and retirees to tailor the plans to meet their individual needs, the Office of Personnel Management said yesterday. The benefit options and premiums were announced at the kickoff of an early-enrollment season for the program. In all, an estimated 20 million Americans are eligible to apply -- civil service and postal employees and retirees active-duty and retired military personnel and spouses, survivors and certain other family members. The program provides a way for government employees and retirees to obtain insurance to cover such costly long-term services as nursing home care, assisted-living care and adult day care. Employees and retirees who sign up gain security because they have the peace of mind knowing that they can maintain their financial independence and personal dignity if they one day are unable to take care of themselves, OPM Director Kay Coles James said. Families gain security because they know they will have the best possible options available to them in the event that they have to make one of life's most difficult choices regarding the care of their parents or loved ones. The program has been in the making for 18 months, and Frank Titus, the OPM official in charge of the program, said the early- enrollment period is being offered in response to pent-up demand from employees and retirees who feel that they need to enroll as soon as possible.
Stocks and bonds rose on a spate of positive economic news, even as many investors remained on the sidelines, contributing to lower-than-average volumes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed the largest gain for the day, rising 0.7, or 71.69 points, to 10353.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index followed suit, rising 0.64, or 11.68 points, to 1824.17, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.58, or 6.62 points, to 1138.49. Traders said the day's minirally in stocks, which fizzled somewhat as the day went on, was led in large part by two promising pieces of data the Conference Board's consumer-confidence index, which climbed to 110.2 in March from 95 in February and statistics from the Department of Commerce indicating that orders for durable goods, or items meant to last several years, rose 1.5 from January to February. Both numbers suggest the economy might be recovering from recession. We had a little boost from consumer confidence, said Steve Bliss, co-head of Nasdaq trading for Cantor Fitzgerald. While Treasury bonds might normally drop on strong economy data, Treasurys rallied because traders interpreted Federal Reserve officials' comments as meaning the Fed won't raise rates soon. Though share volume was higher yesterday than it was Monday, the lightest-volume day on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange so far this year, trading traffic was still below average on a year-to-date basis.
Arthur Andersen said yesterday that it has tentatively agreed to transfer much of its U.S. tax practice to accounting rival Deloitte & Touche LLP in what would be the first major step in its effort to shed non-audit businesses. Andersen said it is following a reform plan outlined by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker, which calls for the firm to stop providing services that conflict with its auditing. Volcker, who heads an internal oversight board at Andersen, has said that the firm should not provide aggressive advice to audit clients on how to reduce their taxes. The agreement calls for a significant number of Andersen's U.S. tax specialists to join Deloitte as soon as April 30, Andersen said. It would provide continuing career opportunities for a significant number of our people, Andersen managing partner Larry Gorrell said in a statement. At the same time, Andersen tax partners are negotiating with a venture capital firm to get 400 million to create stand-alone firm, an Andersen source said. Some partners are hesitant to invest their capital and future in another audit firm. In a conference call yesterday with leaders of the U.S. firm, Andersen partners were told that management is preparing to lay off a third of the firm's audit personnel and make smaller cuts in its consulting and tax practices.
The nation's jobless rate rose last month, but the number of payroll jobs increased and there were other signs that U.S. labor markets are stabilizing after last year's recession. The unemployment rate increased sharply late last year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The rate reached a peak of 5.8 percent in December, fell to 5.6 percent in January and 5.5 percent in February before going up to 5.7 percent last month, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Meanwhile, non-farm employers added 58,000 jobs to payrolls last month, the first increase in eight months, after cutting them by 2,000 in February. The February figure was revised downward significantly from the original estimate of a 66,000 gain. Lois Orr, acting commissioner of labor statistics, said in a prepared statement that the payroll figures for March and February provide a marked contrast to the average monthly job losses of 144,000 that prevailed from March 2001 through January 2002. The jobless rate and number of payroll jobs can move in different directions for several reasons, including the fact that they result from separate surveys. The unemployment rate comes from a monthly survey of about 60,000 U.S. households, the payroll figures from a survey of roughly 350,000 businesses. Labor experts generally regard the payroll numbers as the more accurate measure of changes in the labor market, but the unemployment rate receives more public attention.
New York -- The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 were followed by understandable predictions of a plunge in consumer spending. Those forecasts were based partly on various readings of consumer sentiment, which dropped sharply. Goodbye to one of the few pillars holding up a wobbly economy, observers prematurely concluded. Truth turned out to be stranger than fiction. October 2001 will go down in economic history as the month Americans purchased the greatest number of autos -- ever. While that was largely attributed to auto makers' 0 financing offers, it still leaves unanswered why supposedly depressed Americans were plenty willing to visit -- of all places -- car dealerships. Harder to explain still is why the level of retail spending, after falling in September, has been higher in every succeeding month than it was in August. Indeed, even excluding autos, retail sales grew in every month during the past half-year compared with a year ago. All this while the most closely watched of the two main confidence gauges still hasn't topped pre-Sept. 11 heights. Could it be that consumer sentiment isn't so closely tied to spending behavior after all And if so, what does that mean for the U.S. economy now Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of Deloitte Research, jointly owned by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touch and Deloitte Consulting, believes he has an answer. Mr. Steidtmann compared changes in consumer confidence and consumer spending over the past 20 years. His finding There is very little, if any, relationship between confidence and spending. There are a number of possible explanations for the disconnect, but the most important is that spending and confidence are driven by a different set of factors, he says. Specifically, politics, disasters and war drive confidence, Mr. Steidtmann concludes, while cash flow drives spending. The twain may or may not meet. After Sept. 11, consumer sentiment was buffeted by the terrorist attack, the anthrax mailings and fear of a second blow. But at the same time, cash flow was bolstered by lower interest rates, tax rebates, mortgage refinancings and lower energy prices.
Some people look forward to daylight savings time. Others await baseball's opening pitch. Loop Fans, of course, look forward to the annual presentation of the Congressional Pig Book, with its listing of the most egregious pork-barrel projects from this year's appropriations bills. The 12th annual rollout on Tuesday, complete with hogs of the four-legged variety and a list of the Dirty Dozen -- 12 states that have received the most pork per capita from 1995 to 2002 -- promises to be the best ever. That's because we're hailing record- breaking amounts of pork, 8,341 projects, and a record total of 20.1 billion in chops, ham, roasts and bacon, according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. 14 million for the appropriately named Hollings Marine Laboratory in South Carolina -- as in Sen. Ernest F. Hollings D- S.C.. The small but wonderful 350,000 for the University of Mississippi National Library of the Accounting Profession. 420,000 for Hawthorne Elementary and Junior High School and 249,000 for Schurz Elementary School, both in Nevada, to buy each student a laptop computer.
THE PUBLIC RELATIONS business could use a bit of PR help itself these days. For years, the world's largest advertising-agency holding companies have raced to acquire PR firms as an insurance policy of sorts. With Wall Street clamoring for earnings that wouldn't be rocked by the loss of major ad accounts or cutbacks in ad spending, Omnicom Group Inc. snapped up Fleishman-Hillard Inc. WPP Group PLC bought Hill & Knowlton Inc. and Interpublic Group of Cos. purchased GolinHarris International, among other deals. The ad holding companies and industry analysts said they believed that marketing-services companies such as PR agencies were resistant to economic downturns. Some even considered the sector countercyclical, since companies often need more PR help when they are financially troubled than when times are flush. But as the advertising business suffers through the worst drought in media spending since the Depression, PR firms are struggling, too. Overall revenue for the 4.2 billion U.S. public-relations industry fell 10 to 15 last year, according to the Council of Public Relations Firms. The biggest firms are laying off employees, slashing their prices for the first time in five years and chasing small accounts that they wouldn't have bothered with in the late 1990s boom.
NEW YORK -- Wall Street faced its first big earnings test as General Electric posted first-quarter results. Judging by how the market acted in the trading session, GE failed the test dismally. GE fell 3.45, or 9.3, to 33.75, as 78 million shares changed hands, triple the volume of a typical session. Investors found themselves stung by the quality of the conglomerate's earnings report, which featured lighter revenue in the quarter than analysts anticipated. Investors also were disappointed the company didn't deliver a more robust outlook for the rest of the year than they heard on the conference call executives hosted. In technology, Yahoo sank 2.99, or 16, to 15.45 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after the Internet company posted first-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecast and raised its revenue estimate for this year. But analysts faulted Yahoo for not outperforming expectations and reiterated lingering worries about Yahoo's exposure to the advertising market, which continues to struggle. Meanwhile, Wall Street maintained its bearish posture on the outlook for a profit recovery in the telecommunications sector, driving share prices in one of the market's hardest-hit areas even lower. Verizon Communications, which this week projected weaker earnings than Wall Street has been expecting, fell 2.08, or 4.7, to 41.82, a 52-week low. Sprint dropped 1.23, or 8.3, to 13.62, and SBC Communications sank 1.90, or 5.3, to 33.75, posting a 52-week low of its own. Other concerns only served to compound the problems that Wall Street had with first-quarter results. A research company that tracks the activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission reported that the agency has launched an inquiry into International Business Machines. The shares slid 4.82, or 5.4, to 84.19e, notching a 52-week low.
One important measure of U.S. inflation rose sharply last month as the surge in world oil prices since mid-January began to work its way through the economy, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Producer prices for finished goods rose 1 percent last month, the largest monthly increase since the beginning of last year, principally because of a 5.5 percent jump in energy prices. That included a 21.3 percent increase in the prices refiners charge for gasoline following a 4.5 percent rise in February. However, the rising cost of energy -- evident in recent weeks to motorists at the gas pump -- so far does not appear large enough to derail the U.S. economic recovery. It would take a much larger and more sustained oil price shock to seriously damage the economy, partly because it is significantly less dependent on oil than in the past, analysts said. Moreover, in the past 10 days, world oil prices have fallen by nearly 4.50 a barrel, erasing more than half of the increase that began earlier this year. By one measure, crude oil prices peaked this year at just under 28 a barrel 10 days ago, driven upward largely by rising tensions in the Middle East, the prospect of growing oil demand because of the U.S. economic rebound and the possibility of disruptions in oil shipments from Venezuela because of political turmoil there.
Jeffrey Osborn says he was surprised at how cheap it was to sway Loudoun County's elections. The builders have been buying the county for just dirt, he says. So Osborn, a venture capitalist, set out to beat them at their own game by pumping more than 50,000 into the campaigns to support eight slow-growth candidates for the county board of supervisors in 1999. They all won. Stunned by the defeat, pro-development interests in the Washington suburb have vowed to unseat the new board, which has sliced more than 80,000 houses from county plans. If you are a major player in a billion-dollar industry, are you going to let your industry evaporate asked Bryan Brooks, a local developer. The developers' response Up the ante. That's no small threat in Virginia, known nationally as the Wild West of campaign finance. There are no contribution limits for state or local offices here, making anything possible. If you want to give 6 billion to some guy who's running for sheriff or local delegate, you can do it, says Steve Calos, executive director of the Richmond-based Center for Open, Ethical and Accountable Government. Big money goes small town You betcha. Americans are used to thinking of national politics as the place where the big decisions get made -- and where the big money gets spent. That premise drove the campaign finance reform legislation President Bush signed last month. But that ballyhooed legislation did nothing to stem the flow of money to local and state campaigns. Local politics are just as fortified -- some say corrupted -- by cash as federal ones, and often more so. From the Blue Ridge mountain foothills of Loudoun to Laguna Hills, Calif., the excesses of K Street are flourishing on the Main Streets that lead to the nation's state houses, city halls and county buildings. The most intimate arena of our democracy can also be the easiest to manipulate. A little money can go a long way in local contests. The rules are looser, and fewer people are watching to see if those rules are followed. Voter turnout is often lower, giving one-issue champions and special interest groups greater influence. As on Capitol Hill, contributions often make great investments. People don't give money to honor America or show their love of democracy. They are buying something, says Calos. Money buys results.
The Bush administration is poised to complete the biggest increase in government spending since the 1960s' Great Society, the result of conducting the war on terrorism while substantially boosting the education and transportation budgets, according to a detailed analysis of government spending patterns. Spending on government programs will increase by 22 percent from 1999 to 2003 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the analysis by The Washington Post and vetted by budget experts in both parties. The president's 2003 budget proposals, combined with spending approved in the first year of his administration and the last two years of the Clinton administration, dwarf the spending increase from any four-year period since President Lyndon Johnson fought the Vietnam War while launching a war on poverty. Other periods of substantial increases in domestic spending, including the Nixon and Carter administrations, were accompanied by cuts in military spending. President Ronald Reagan boosted money for the mili- tary while trimming the domestic budget. In the short term, the latest spending hike is one factor helping to pull the nation out of recession. But over the long run, some experts say, most of the spending will be a drag on the economy, heighten the risk of sustained budget deficits and limit the maneuvering room of policymakers when, 10 years from now, the government must help fund the baby boomers' health care and retirement needs. We should be very concerned, said John Cogan, a budget expert at the Hoover Institution who advised the Bush campaign. Clearly, the defense and national security increases are warranted. The failure to offset those increases with reductions should be a source of concern. The wrong thing to do is not confront those choices.
WASHINGTON AP -- U.S. companies, keeping a close eye on the economic recovery, whittled excess stocks of unsold goods in February for the 13th consecutive month. Stockpiles of unsold goods on shelves and back lots dipped by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That pushed the value of inventories down to 1.13 trillion, the lowest level since November 1999. The drop in inventories came even as businesses' sales slid by 0.9, the biggest decline in three months. With inventories getting lean, prospects are raised that factories, which are already slowly boosting production after a sharp cutback, will need to crank it up more in the coming months, economists said. That's something that would help the country as it recovers from a recession. As the economy stages a comeback, companies are working hard to gauge consumers' and businesses' appetite for their products, something that can be especially tricky when the economy is in transition, economists said.
MEMO TO EMPLOYERS Guess who's starting to call the shots again As the economy shows signs of a nascent recovery, some job seekers are taking an increasingly bold -- and sometimes manipulative -- approach to finding work. Disillusioned by the sweeping layoffs and corporate penny-pinching of the past 18 months, they are employing tactics typically reserved for more robust times, such as accepting two job offers at once and then playing one prospective employer off against the other. Some keep searching for jobs after starting a new post and then jump ship when they find something better. Others, meantime, are holding two good positions at one time, a split of loyalties they hope might blunt the blow of future layoffs. After 10 frustrating months of unemployment, Sandra Gesburg accepted a sales representative job in early February at Advanced Toxicology Network, a Memphis, Tenn., laboratory that provides workplace drug testing. But just three weeks later, she was offered a better position and 25 salary increase from Professional Resources Screening Inc., a Concord, Calif., provider of pre-employment screening. Although the company had turned her down for a job once before, that was no matter -- 48-year-old Ms. Gesburg immediately took the post. They made me an offer I couldn't refuse, she says matter-of-factly. Stuart Bogema, Ms. Gesburg's old boss and ATN's chief executive, says he wasn't too happy with Ms. Gesburg's quick departure. She hadn't even worked long enough for us to see if she was going to be an able employee or not, says Dr. Bogema. When someone leaves after only a few weeks, that level of trust disappears. The attitude shift among employees comes after months of turbulent times. Companies from Cisco and Lucent to WorldCom have slashed thousands of jobs since early 2001. Others have re-assigned employees at random, delayed start dates and forced job seekers to jump through all sorts of hoops before extending an offer. More recently, the scandals at Enron Corp. and Arthur Andersen, which have cost thousands their jobs and retirement savings, have intensified employee cynicism -- and validated their efforts to look after themselves.
Short interest at the Nasdaq Stock Market reached its highest point in four months, as the market's composite index dropped. The number of short-selling positions not yet closed out edged up 1 to 4,124,763,193 shares in the month through April 15 -- up from 4,085,825,647 shares on March 15. Investors who sell securities short borrow stock and sell it, betting the stock's price will fall, and they will be able to buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender. Short interest often is considered an indication of the level of skepticism in the market. Short interest reflects the number of shares that have yet to be repurchased to give back to lenders. In general, the higher the short interest, the more people are expecting a downturn. Some investors will allocate part of their portfolio to a professional short seller to hedge, or protect, their assets in case the market falls. Investors also may rely on short selling for other purposes, including a hedging strategy related to corporate mergers and acquisitions, hedging convertible securities and options, or tax-related reasons. The next Nasdaq short-selling report will be published in The Wall Street Journal on May 27.
It was a bumpy year for So Others Might Eat, the District-based charity known as SOME, which provides food, clothing, medical care and other services to those in need. Just months before the charity was to open a glossy building in Northwest Washington, the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, and SOME's donations plummeted 30 percent as Americans turned their attention - - and wallets -- to that cause. Then came the anthrax postal scare, and the charity group's mail dried up for several weeks. For a nonprofit organization that gets more than half its funding in small donations through the mail, it was a staggering one-two punch, said development coordinator Shonna Milliken Humphrey. But last week, the 30-year-old organization finally got some good news. Employees participating in the workplace fundraising campaign of the United Way of the National Capital Area had designated 1.4 million for SOME -- a whopping 40 percent more than in the previous year. The news was a big relief to the organization. The picture has similarly brightened for some other charities that were predicting hard times in the fall. After donating almost 2 billion to Sept. 11 funds nationally, Americans seem to have returned to supporting their usual causes. Although not all charities have rebounded to their pre-Sept. 11 levels, many now report that their worst fears never came to pass.
DESCRIPTION NVR is far and away the largest builder in the Washington area and one of the top 10 builders of single-family homes in the country. It offers condominiums and single-family homes in 18 areas in 11 states. DEVELOPMENTS Over the past year NVR rode the strong housing market, with its low interest rates and strong buyer demand, and earnings grew accordingly. For fiscal 2001, NVR earned 236.79 million, compared with 158.25 million in 2000. Gross revenue for 2001 was 2.62 billion, compared with 2.32 billion the year before. Executives at the builder attributed the increase to favorable market conditions and the company's focus on controlling costs. NVR is regarded as the country's most financially efficient home builder. It tends to earn a higher return than other builders because it doesn't tie up large amounts of capital in land purchases, choosing instead to buy options on lots. The company's present backlog of orders should ensure a revenue stream for a long time, analysts said. In a survey by the California research firm J.D. Power & Associates, consumers ranked Ryan Homes, an NVR affiliate active in the Washington market, the second-best builder in the country in terms of customer satisfaction. Approximately 48 percent of NVR's home settlements during 2001 occurred in the Washington-Baltimore region, which amounted to 59 percent of NVR's 2001 home-building revenue. NVR is thus heavily dependent on the economy and the demand for housing in the Washington area, which stayed relatively strong throughout 2001.
The Bush administration has proposed ending fixed-rate consolidations of federal student loans just as interest rates are forecast to plunge to record lows. With lower interest rates, student borrowers could save thousands of dollars over the life of their loans. White House officials raised the idea of ending the government- subsidized consolidations as part of a supplementary spending bill for the current fiscal year being developed by the House Appropriations Committee. The proposal is one of three preliminary suggestions forwarded by the White House to deal with a 1.3 billion shortfall in the Pell Grant program for low-income students. It ran into immediate opposition from congressional Democrats, some Republicans and student advocates who said it would effectively raise interest rates for the estimated 700,000 borrowers who consolidate, or refinance their total federal student loan debt, each year. At a time when we are looking for ways to make college more affordable, it is inconceivable that the Bush White House would send a proposal to Congress that would make it harder for working families to pay tuition bills, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli D-N.J. said yesterday. Rep. George Miller Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the proposal grossly unfair to students who borrowed billions with the promise they could consolidate and get a better interest rate. Now, when they have to pay back the loans, the Bush administration wants to change the rules and increase repayment costs to graduates.
Outside the Montgomery County Council office building, dozens of people pushing baby strollers gathered yesterday to protest the elimination of a parenting program. Inside, the council had just approved costly police and fire labor agreements that could make paying for such services even harder. The situation underscores what County Council analysts say is a fundamental problem faced by budget writers The spiraling cost of labor agreements negotiated by County Executive Douglas M. Duncan D and approved by the council is forcing sharp reductions in a host of other areas, from pothole filling to recreation programs. Employee salaries and benefits, which before two years ago accounted for about 60 percent of the county government's budget, will eat up 66 percent next year. That's an increase of 47.3 million. Although the county's population continues to grow, the increase wasn't driven by adding legions of positions During that time, the workforce grew by 2.7 percent. So what's going on Over the past few years, as health costs have grown and the economy has slowed, Duncan and the council have approved costly wage increases and sweetened retirements for police, fire and general government workers. Next year, for instance, retirement benefit costs will increase 15.7 million, 34.1 percent over this year, largely because of bargaining agreements approved in 2001. Council staff director Stephen B. Farber called that jump extraordinary.
This ought to be a glorious moment for the telecommunications industry. Around the world, people are spending record amounts of money to use its networks to talk and e-mail and exchange gobs of information. The pace of technological innovation is positively breathtaking. Trillions of dollars have been invested in its growth. Instead, the industry is in the midst of a financial meltdown. The ouster this week of founder Bernard J. Ebbers as chairman of WorldCom Inc. is but the latest twist in a saga that almost certainly will involve more resignations, more bankruptcies and a period of painful industry consolidation. The ripples from the telecom implosion extend well beyond the industry. It has become a significant factor holding back the economic recovery, not just in the United States but also globally. The stock market's current funk stems in significant part from concern over telecom stocks, which drove the late-'90s rally but since their peak have generated paper losses of more than 1 trillion, by some estimates. The amount of telecom debt and equity investments already written off by banks, bondholders, venture capitalists and private equity funds approaches 500 billion and continues to rise. Without expectations of robust growth in this debt-ridden, risky, increasingly competitive sector, the economics of the telecom sector simply don't work, declared Scott Cleland of the Precursor Group research firm in Washington, who sees no revival in sight. In the boom years, there seemed no limit to telecom's prospects. Success bred success, confidence led to more confidence, growth produced growth. Now the same feeding-on-itself dynamic is at work in reverse, dragging with it not only weak companies but the strong as well.
Everyone has his favorite household remedy. Mom is partial to chicken soup, Uncle Pete prefers a shot of Jack Daniels and over at the National Association of Manufacturers they like to prescribe a weak U.S. dollar. With the U.S. trade deficit still large, the weak-dollar boys are back selling their elixir to Congress. Our old friend Jerry Jasinowski, head of NAM, was his typically laid-back self this week, explaining that an overvalued dollar is decimating U.S. manufactured-good exports, artificially stimulating imports and putting hundreds of thousands of American workers out of work. How it managed to cause all of this mayhem while the economy was growing by some 5.8 in the first quarter must constitute a miracle. Either that, or maybe a strong greenback isn't quite the economic disaster he claims. The U.S. had a robust currency all throughout the 1990s when times were flush. The same was true for most of the 1980s, though we recall similar moaning about the Reagan dollar. The worst recent decade for U.S. economic policy was the 1970s, when the Nixon and Carter Treasuries decided to take NAM's advice and debase the dollar. Nirvana did not arrive. NAM's argument isn't economic policy so much as special pleading. Its members have to cope with rugged foreign competition, and they're looking for some government relief. They figure that the inefficient steelmakers got theirs -- tariffs -- so it's only fair that they now get a similar break. A dollar devaluation would be a kind of universal tariff on imports. You'd think Mr. Jasinowski would worry about the company he's keeping here. His allies include the AFL-CIO, that free-market paragon, and in the Senate the likes of Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, who has never met a tax or regulation he didn't like. He's only too happy to flack for NAM when it gives him a chance to whack foreign imports.
MeriStar Hotels & Resorts Inc. of the District said it is merging with Interstate Hotels Corp. of Pittsburgh in a deal valued at 68 million that will make it one of the largest independent hotel- management companies. The combined company will be called Interstate Hotels Corp. and will be based in the District. It will have estimated pro forma revenue of 340 million for 2002 from the 412 hotels in the United States, Canada and Europe that it will operate. The deal, whose value is based on MeriStar's closing stock price of 1.21 on Wednesday, is expected to close by the summer. MeriStar runs 277 hotels in 42 states, the District and Canada, as well as Doral resorts and conference centers and one of the world's largest corporate housing systems. Interstate operates 135 hotels in 37 states, the District, Canada and Russia. Under the deal, each MeriStar share will be swapped for one share in the new group. Interstate shareholders would get 4.6 shares for each share they hold.
Adelphia Communications Corp., the nation's sixth-largest cable-television concern that has come under regulatory scrutiny for possible improper accounting, said its founder John J. Rigas resigned as chairman and chief executive and the company launched an internal investigation amid allegations of additional improper business dealings with the Rigas family. Mr. Rigas's departure, at the behest of two of the cable company's outside directors, was an apparent effort to shore up investor confidence in the Coudersport, Pa., company, whose stock has withered in recent weeks. But the move may be too late to save Adelphia from a cash crunch and bankruptcy proceedings, according to credit-ratings agencies and people familiar with the situation. Adelphia must make a 50 million interest payment on its 14 billion debt this week. Adelphia also is scheduled to appear today at a hearing before the Nasdaq Stock Market over its possible delisting, a move that would allow bondholders to require Adelphia to pay out 1.4 billion in cash. Yesterday, both Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corp. downgraded Adelphia's credit rating, already below junk status. Moody's in a statement said, The prospect of a potential bankruptcy filing is more likely and may ultimately be unavoidable. The company named Erland E. Kailbourne, a board member and former executive of Fleet National Bank, to be chairman and interim chief executive. Adelphia disclosed in April that the company had co-guaranteed 2.3 billion in loans to entities owned by the Rigas family. A portion of the funds was used by the family to buy Adelphia stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a formal investigation of Adelphia and the loan agreements.
THE U.S. STOCK MARKET is showing some signs of recovery, but there is a problem lurking in the background foreigners. Foreign investors, whose purchases in 2000 almost equaled those of U.S. equity mutual funds and who were steady buyers even last year, have pulled their horns in. They aren't quite net sellers yet, but their net buying has almost dried up. That helps explain why the market has been soft -- especially the stocks of big, well-known companies favored by foreign investors -- and why the dollar has been under pressure. The risk is that the disenchantment with U.S. stocks could continue and that foreign investors could even become net sellers, further hurting the U.S. market. Foreign demand for U.S. assets is coming under strain, says Paul Meggyesi, a senior foreign-exchange analyst at Deutsche Bank. With little sign of improvement in the U.S. asset market this is a problem which we believe will continue for some time to come. Last week, stocks rose led by continued demand for technology shares in particular. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 8.8, or 140.54 points, to 1741.39 following five straight days of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, was up 4.2, or 413.16 points, from a week earlier to 10353.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also gained 4.9 for the week.
Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett entered the public debate over stock-option accounting by suggesting that companies list as expenses only options given to top executives. The chip maker, at its annual shareholders meeting in Santa Clara, Calif., also said it would formalize a CEO performance review that was handled more casually in the past. The new policy came as Intel went to great lengths to distance itself from the accounting controversies and management improprieties ensnaring companies such as Enron Corp. Mr. Barrett said his accounting proposal wouldn't penalize companies such as Intel that grant most of their options to employees outside the executive suite. But it would minimize abuse at the top, he said. He suggested that only options given to the company's top five officers be listed against income. The prospect of having to account for options as an expense is controversial in Silicon Valley, where companies commonly use stock grants as employee incentives. The concerns are reflected in a bill, introduced by Senators Carl Levin D., Mich. and John McCain R., Ariz., that would force the accounting changes. Options costs currently are listed as balance-sheet footnotes and don't affect quarterly income statements.
THE CURRENT STATE of the bed-and-breakfast business belies the belief that bigger is better. When sized up against their larger brethren in the lodging industry, bed-and-breakfast inns, which typically have 25 rooms or fewer, appear to have fared better since the recession hit the U.S. economy last spring. And they bounced back quicker from the vacancies brought on by the events of Sept. 11. To a certain extent, bed and breakfasts are shielded from recessionary effects, says Robert Mandelbaum, research director at PKF Consulting, a hospitality advisory firm, who helps the Professional Association of Innkeepers International compile data from its biennial industry survey. Guests of bed-and-breakfast inns tend to be affluent leisure travelers who are less likely to be susceptible to change during a recession, he says. Average occupancy or room-rate data for the bed-and-breakfast sector is difficult to come by. Jerry Phillips, executive director of the Professional Association of Innkeepers, estimates there are about 18,000 bed-and-breakfast and country inns in the U.S., with about 36 in the Northeast, 28 in the West, 20 in the South and 15 in the Midwest. Many inns, particularly those within driving distance of New York City, fared well after the attacks as people canceled their vacations and opted instead for getaways that didn't involve hopping on an airplane, says Bill Oates, a consultant in Brattleboro, Vt.
Mutual-fund managers are seeking shelter from a rainy market in home-building stocks these days. But the sector's foundation might be cracking under the weight of steep gains and all its newfound fans. The number of mutual funds owning small and midsize home-building stocks like Lennar Corp. and Centex Corp. has risen sharply, doubling in some cases, since the start of last year. And it's easy to see why Consumers taking advantage of low interest rates to buy, refinance and remodel their homes have boosted these companies' fortunes, pushing up the average price of the sector's small-cap and midcap stocks by 171 over the past two years through Friday's close, according to BaselineThomson Financial. Faced with slumping growth-stock categories such as technology, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals and with 40 of U.S. stock funds in the red over the past three years, some battered fund managers also have piled into shares of larger home builders and related outfits such as home-improvement retailer Lowe's Cos. and mortgage titan Freddie Mac. Some see the home builders as a rare haven for cheap valuations and better-than-average growth in lean times. But others worry the small and midsize stocks have risen too high, too fast and that quick-trading managers of mutual funds and hedge funds who have hopped on the bandwagon could be just as quick to jump off. Their heavy selling can cause the prices of these smallish stocks to sink. I've met with about 40 hedge-fund managers last week and if it's going up they're buyers, but they'll be just as quick to leave too, says Jeffrey Saut, chief equity strategist at Raymond James. They do look attractive but this is usually when you want to sell them. You buy pessimism and sell optimism. Hedge funds are private partnerships for large investors and seek quick profits by putting huge sums in global currency, stock and bond markets.
WASHINGTON -- The median U.S. household income rose almost 8 faster than inflation during the booming 1990s, reaching 41,994 by 1999, according to newly released census data. The overall percentage of Americans living in poverty, however, fell only slightly to 12.4 from 13.1 in 1989, by the federal definition that set the income limit at 16,895 for a family of four in 1999. The percentage of Americans 65 and over with poverty status dropped to 9.9 from 12.8. The information, some of the most detailed yet from the 2000 Census, was compiled from long-form questionnaires that were given to roughly 17 of all U.S. households. They offer a glimpse into a variety of demographic trends, including the types of jobs people have, their education level, and how many cars they own. Short-form data, released last year, pertain mostly to population counts, housing and race. The long-form data show, for instance, that homes where only English is spoken dropped to 82.1 from 86.2, while the percentage of Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher rose to 24.4 from 20.3 a decade earlier. The new income data show that poverty rates fell in parts of the South and the Midwest, though many rural areas continued to be some of the poorest communities, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. Without adjusting for inflation, the median income rose almost 40 from 30,056. The percentage of households earning more than 150,000 nearly tripled, to 4.6.
The economic boom of the 1990s raised the incomes of the poorest Americans, held the size of the middle class steady and swelled the ranks of those with six-digit incomes, according to census data released yesterday. The figures confirm a long-term momentum that has given millions of Americans significantly more income since 1980, the share of the U.S. population earning more than 100,000 annually has doubled, after adjusting for inflation. That upward income mobility was so broad that, when the census was taken two years ago, 5 out of 6 Americans lived in counties in which the lowest niches -- those with incomes of less than 15,000 -- were shrinking. But there were notable exceptions, places where the middle class shrank while the ranks of the rich and poor expanded. They included a swath of major metropolitan areas from Washington through Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, as well as large parts of Southern California. Poverty may have grown in those areas because of high numbers of immigrants from poor countries, experts say, or in some cases, an ailing local economy. It's a positive picture overall, said John Logan, a sociology professor at the State University of New York in Albany, who compiled his own study of census data for metropolitan areas.
Adelphia Communications Corp.'s woes continued to mount as the cable concern disclosed it overstated revenue and cash flow by about 500 million over the past two years. Two of the company's newest board members resigned over the ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing at Adelphia. The news comes as Adelphia moves closer to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, something many analysts expect to happen by the end of next week, given Adelphia's cash constraints and a looming 50 million interest payment it must make by Saturday. Adelphia has begun discussions with banks about potential bankruptcy financing of as much as 1 billion or more, which would allow the company to continue operating under bankruptcy protection, according to people familiar with the matter. In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adelphia provided some results from its own internal review launched several weeks ago after it was disclosed that the founding Rigas family had benefited from more than 3 billion in loans from the company. In its filing, Adelphia blamed former management, which included the Rigas family. The company said that current management believes information provided by prior management, including the amount of the company's cable system that has been rebuilt, was unreliable and said Adelphia plans to correct the information, where material, as current management develops information it considers reliable.
THE PROBLEM What happens when an expected tidal wave of business reveals itself to be a brief splash Mark Kolb, chief executive of Taratec Development Corp., of Bridgewater, N.J., is the first to admit he was unprepared for the spring of 2000. Spending for our services just dried up, he says. We were caught off guard. Though he didn't realize it at the time, Taratec, an information-technology consultant to large pharmaceutical companies, had been an unwitting beneficiary of the Y2K computer crunch. Through the late 1990s, big corporations, including his clients, shoveled piles of cash at software and hardware consultants, anticipating computer snarl-ups when the digital calendar turned to the year '00. Even though Taratec did little Y2K work, by 1999, Mr. Kolb employed 100 and was looking at record revenue of 17 million. He told his partners to prepare for a public offering in 2000. He was proud that a business launched from his living-room coffee table in 1984 had reached this grand juncture. But in the first quarter of 2000, new business evaporated. The stock market tanked. Y2K was a nonevent. We didn't realize how much of our 1999 revenue was driven by Y2K budgets, he says. For the first time ever, annual revenue fell.
STOCKS MANAGED to avoid a retreat following Monday's big gain. Many investors had feared a pullback after stocks put in big gains on Friday afternoon and again on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 213.21 points. Instead, the industrial average yesterday rose an additional 0.19, or 18.70 points, to 9706.12. That means that the blue chips now are up 445.13 points since hitting an intraday low of 9260.99 during trading on Friday. Considering the gains we had from the worst of Friday through Monday, it is a pretty positive sign that the market didn't give it back, said Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at New York mutual-fund group Dreyfus. Now, the market is taking a pause and people are stepping back to see what shakes out and where we are headed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.09, or 0.97 point, to 1037.14, leaving it down 10 this year. Technology stocks fell back, however, pulling the Nasdaq Composite Index down 0.67, or 10.33 points, to 1542.96, down 21 so far this year. The Dow industrials are down 3 this year.
