Four out of five people surveyed last month by Louis Harris & Associates agreed that Wall Street generally benefits the nation. The 80 positive response was up sharply from the 70 who held that view in a similar Harris poll last year. But some other findings indicate many Americans still think of the big banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that make up Wall Street as a kingdom populated by large numbers of ethical pygmies. For example, a majority of those surveyed agreed that most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it.

All that can be said is that the economic crisis that began quietly in Thailand in July has now spread to much of Asia -- including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong -- and moved on to Brazil and even Russia. It could snowball into a broader economic downturn that would drag much of the world with it. Will it The prevailing view is no. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last week that Asia's problems, though serious, won't trigger a U.S. recession. The Economist also doubts a global slump. But optimism needs to be tempered, because the optimists have -- so far -- been wrong. The crisis is already worse than they expected, and plenty could still go wrong. Banking crises across Asia are a possibility. Another bad omen the decision of the Mercosur trading bloc Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay to raise tariffs 25 percent. This could signal a protectionist spiral that would depress world trade. The best that can be expected is that the crisis harms only a handful of countries. For them, economic growth drops sharply. Consider new estimates from Nariman Behravesh, chief global forecaster for Standard & Poor's DRI. The table below contrasts his forecasts before and after Asia's latest stock market and currency declines in late October and early November. Japan stumbles because its exports to Asia falter. And other countries are overextended. What we're seeing today is the tail end of the capital flow cycle, says economist Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland. In the 1990s, these countries have received massive foreign investment. Too much money flowed too quickly. First, foreign capital mostly dollars was converted into local currencies. Bad loans were made, bad projects were financed. Next, local consumers and companies converted some local currency back into foreign exchange to buy imports. Trade deficits swelled. Everyone's a genius in a boom, says Reinhart. And now the boom is over. Countries must curb trade deficits because they no longer receive the foreign capital needed to gorge on imports. Interest rates go up to slow spending. Brazil raised tariffs to choke imports. Other countries let their currencies depreciate this makes imports more expensive and exports less expensive. Yet, Behravesh doesn't expect the world economy to slump. He's cut his 1998 forecast for global growth only slightly, from 2.9 to 2.5 percent. Though the United States and Europe lose some exports, their economies continue to expand. Most developed countries escape the crisis.";0;1

Again, this may be a surprise to investors still jittery after the Oct. 27 stock plunge and the gyrations in global markets since then. And the same lower-rate scenario that supports the bullish argument also makes the stock market more vulnerable to higher rates than it has been in some time. But here is the bullish case Lower interest rates raise the present value of a company's future earnings. That is because an investor puts a higher price on future earnings if he or she will earn less in competing investments, like bonds. Furthermore, the effect accelerates the lower rates go.

Meanwhile, for the South as a whole, per-capita income in the 14 states surveyed rose one percentage point to 90 of the U.S. average.

What is wrong with policythat is, politically drivenloans Potentially nothing if they were made to firms to finance expansions that just happened to coincide with a rise in consumer or business or overseas demand for their newly produced products, the Fed chairman said.

Culver, Scott and Hawn Letters to the Editor, Nov. 10 for the opportunity to correct several of their common misunderstandings about fuel grade ethanol. Dave Culver, in his concern over the projected production cost of ethanol, makes no mention of the true costs of imported oil. When externalities such as environmental and health costs, the loss of domestic jobs and basic industries, the trade deficit, commitments of military resources to ensure the free flow of oil from the Middle East and threats to our energy and national security are included, the true cost of imports even now exceeds 100bbl, according to the General Accounting Office. Mr. Culver is off by a factor of almost 10 in his claim that Vehicles that consume a 10 mixture of gasohol' typically see a 20 loss in fuel mileage. Between 2 and 4 is correct. He is a bit closer in his description of E-85 vehicles. At this time, they experience about a 20 reduction in range compared to gasoline. That will improve with higher compression ratio engines allowed by ethanol's 113 octane. He is just flat wrong about fires and fuel system incompatibility with ethanol. John W. Scott is correct in warning that the production of ethanol and other biofuels from feed grains and oilseeds, from agriculture and forestry residues, fast growing trees and grasses and well as from urban biomass heading for the dump, must ensure environmental integrity from the dirt to the tailpipe. The sloshing down the river of 15 gallons of top soil for every gallon of ethanol simply does not occur with modern, environmentally sound farming practices including crop rotation, conservation tillage, planting and harvesting, filter strips and the scientific use of agricultural chemicals. As the nation commercializes the conversion of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulosic biomass, the planting of grasses and trees on erodible land will bring increasing levels of top soil to farm lands, a process already well under way. Richard G. Hawn needs to visit Brazil to verify his claims of poor-running cars and double-the-size gas tanks. Essentially all cars in Brazil run on ethanol, either in blends of 22 ethanol78 gasoline or 99 ethanol a little touch of denaturant to keep the imbibers away. They run well and the public is pleased. The fuel tanks are about 20 larger than they would be if straight gasoline were used. He is right about the Btu content of ethanol being lower than gasoline -- 76,000 Btu compared with about 119,000 for gasoline. But he neglected to mention that the increased thermal efficiency of ethanol when combusted and its much higher octane permits engine designs that will almost remove the Btu advantage of gasoline. He also failed to mention that air quality in San Paulo Brazil, with a population of 14 million, is better than in Los Angeles, New York City or Houston Texas. There are, of course, externalities in this observation -- and I will show mine when the oil companies show theirs.";1;0

It seems that the majority in this county are more concerned with their short-term financial well-being than with the long-term well-being of our children. Throwing money at the schools isn't going to solve any problems, anyway. The ineffectiveness of schools has very little to do with funding the problem is that the entire setup is heavily flawed. Children are not evolutionarily prepared for sitting long hours in desks while teachers try to impart knowledge upon them. What they mostly learn is how to give the teacher what she wants in order to make the grade. If, as so many experts say, children's education hinges on parental involvement, then the county should focus on encouraging that. The ultimate example of parental involvement in education is home schooling, which is proven to be highly effective for children with a wide variety of needs, interests and abilities. We should stop throwing money at the education problem and encourage greater parental involvement.

The prospect of a sustained budget surplus is a very useful platform to finally get to a point where the Social Security problem is something which is truly resolvable, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. That may not be the case a number of years from now, he warned, adding that it would be a real tragedy if we failed to employ this particular platform as the beginning of the solution to this problem. Meanwhile, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said yesterday that simply transferring projected federal surpluses into the Social Security Trust Fund, one of several options expected to come under consideration in the coming debate over reforming the retirement system, would delay the fund's depletion by 10 years. Offering a preview of administration budget estimates to be released next week, Mr. Summers said surpluses will be projected to be at least 1 trillion over the next 10 years. Every 100 billion transferred into the Social Security fund would extend its life by one year, he said. Though Mr. Greenspan has no direct role in the budget process, his tremendous credibility on Capitol Hill has made him an influential voice in such debates in recent years.

"842613494";"1998-02-09";"WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing. Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997. The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2 last month from 8.9 a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9 last month, down from 2.1 a year earlier. The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them. The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7 of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to 12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors. In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week.";1;0

The U.S. economy continues to roll, with 358,000 jobs created last month as wages rise, unemployment remains low and the Dow Jones average forges ahead. Maybe, a member of Congress might think, the Asian financial storm has blown past. Maybe we don't have to give the International Monetary Fund all those billions the Clinton administration is pressing for. If only it were so. Unfortunately, on many levels, it is too soon to relax. For millions of workers and their families in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and elsewhere, trouble is just beginning. Even if their nations' currencies and stock markets have bottomed out, the consequences of rising unemployment, slowed economic growth and declining standards of living have yet to unfold. To some extent, such consequences are unavoidable. But Americans have more than a humanitarian interest in mitigating Asia's pain. So far, the economic impact on the United States has been, if anything, beneficial, as Asia's crisis dampens inflationary pressure here. But in the coming months the impact is likely to be less positive, as competitive pressures threaten some American jobs. And if the economic crisis worsens and provokes ethnic riots in Indonesia and social instability elsewhere, the national security and economic impact on the United States could be adverse in the extreme. Moreover, the financial situation remains precarious. This is especially so in Indonesia, where the dictatorial President Suharto refuses to recognize the need for more democracy or to prepare the ground for a political transition. Democratic South Korea is in far better shape, thanks to the earnestness and skill with which President-elect Kim Dae Jung has devoted himself to far-reaching economic reform. But even South Korea remains vulnerable to shifts in fickle and sometimes irrational international financial flows. So do nations not yet infected, or barely infected, by the Asian contagion, from China to Hong Kong to Russia to Brazil. Any one of these developing nations, or all of them, could be tripped up by a congressional refusal to support the IMF. Critics attack the IMF, the international organization leading the financial rescues of Asia's economies, on two grounds. Some accept its importance but cite the mistakes it has made. It has made mistakes, and it does need to be more open in its functioning.

As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000.

IMF officials are now talking hopefully about an agreement in principle that would allow Mr. Suharto to save face by keeping the currency-board option alive but delaying implementation of it until banking-sector and debt issues can be addressed. That could take at least six months, a near-eternity in the current crisis. A currency board would take over the role of the central bank in strengthening Indonesia's currency, which has lost 73 of its value since last summer. Under a board, an approach used in Argentina and Hong Kong, a government pledges to buy its currency at a fixed rate against a designated foreign currency, in this case the U.S. dollar, and to hold enough foreign reserves to back all its currency in circulation. The IMF, the U.S. and other donor countries have argued strongly against a currency board for Indonesia, saying it would do more harm to the economy than good unless banking and other economic reforms were fully in place.

The upgrade to A3 from Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. was certainly good news for scores of investors who own city debt, either through mutual funds or by holding individual bonds. Both the current rating and the old one are investment grade, but the one-notch upgrade could mean that more mutual funds and other institutional investors will buy city debt. Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been. Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus.

In real terms, adjusted for inflation, spending on production of planes, ships, tanks and ammunition has fallen 70 percent since 1985. This year, though, the Clinton administration is trying to reverse that slide, asking Congress in the president's recently released budget for the first real increase in defense procurement in 13 years. As the chart at the right shows, this reversal comes as the overall defense budget -- which includes spending for operations, maintenance and personnel in addition to weaponry -- is barely rising. When adjusted for inflation, it actually shows a 1 percent decline. It's certainly fair to say the deep cuts in procurement over the past 10 years are over, said Steven M. Kosiak, budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. President Clinton's budget seeks 48.7 billion for new weaponry in fiscal 1999, up nearly 9 percent from 44.8 billion in the current year's budget. By 2000, the plan calls for 54.1 billion in procurement spending, and the number rises to 63.5 billion by 2003.

In any event, the consensus view that the trade deficit -- to be more precise, the current-account deficit, which measures the excess of payments for imports of goods and services including capital services over earnings from the corresponding exports -- will soar is based on several seemingly persuasive arguments. First, U.S. markets will experience a flood of cheap exports from Asia following the depreciation of many Asian currencies by more than 50 in the past year, and of the Japanese yen by more than 25 in the past two years.

Home values rose 4.9 in 1997, well above the nation's average inflation rate of 1.7, according to an index that tracks repeat home sales compiled by mortgage buyers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That means U.S. home prices have climbed faster than inflation for three straight years. The country hasn't seen such good news on the housing front since the late 1980s. Perhaps the biggest surprise in the index was the gain posted by Flint, Mich., a gritty factory town of about 430,000 whose economic woes were chronicled in the quirky 1989 documentary Roger & Me. With auto makers hiring again, Flint's housing prices jumped 25 last year. The median home price in Flint was 102,845, up 64 from 1990.";1;0

After years of deficits, the upbeat projections indicate that the city's recently announced 185.9 million surplus for 1997 was not a one-time achievement. Instead, it marked a turning point in the city's rebound from the depths of a financial crisis that may enable local leaders to cut taxes, officials said. D.C. financial control board Chairman Andrew F. Brimmer said the city's finances have improved so substantially that both residents and businesses may get a tax cut later this year. Rather than amassing large surpluses and having money in the bank, Brimmer said, part of the surpluses could be used to fund a tax reduction that would make the city a more attractive place to live and work. Brimmer said the details of a tax cut would have to be determined through serious discussions involving the D.C. Council and Mayor Marion Barry, who also has said he favors cutting taxes. The taxpayers in the District ought to look forward to a tax reduction, Brimmer said. The capacity is there.";0;1

Costs for package-hauling are also creeping upward. The U.S. Postal Service hopes to raise rates on its Priority Mail expedited service this year to 3.20 for a letter from 3.00, twice as big an increase as its last price boost in 1995. And giant United Parcel Service of America Inc. brought its commercial ground-transportation prices up 3.6 last month, partially to pay for its hefty new labor settlement with the Teamsters. Already, a wide range of shippers, from chemical concerns to farmers, are noticing the shift. The drugstore giant Walgreen Co. says trucking companies just told it about a planned 5 rate hike, no small sum for a company that spends about 100 million a year on trucking. You do your best in bargaining them down, says Tom Stedman, director of corporate transportation. The price increases are coming at a time when overall inflation in the U.S. has been tame. The consumer price index, the nation's broadest measure of consumer price inflation, rose just 1.7 in 1997. And with commodity prices falling and inexpensive imports flooding into the country because of Asia's currency crisis, few economists believe rising transportation costs are enough to re-ignite inflation. But if those deflationary extras disappear, economists see cause for concern. At the very least, they say, corporate profits could suffer.";1;0

When Thailand turned to Chuan Leekpai to take over the premiership last November, the country was the epicenter of the Asian economic meltdown. Its currency, the baht, was in free fall, the stock market was plummeting, the banking and finance system was a shambles and a hapless government gave the widespread impression that Thailand was in a collective state of denial, unable or unwilling to institute a badly needed but painful restructuring of the economy. In just four months, Chuan and his widely respected team of economic technocrats have turned that perception around. He bluntly warns of even tougher times ahead, but he is unwavering in his public determination to implement the stringent reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund. As a result, Chuan is riding an unprecedented wave of popularity, with a 73 percent approval rating, according to one recent survey.

Most of them are teenagers the rest, working mothers. Before the last increase I wrote letters to the president and my congressmen. I explained that the mandated wage increase was only the tip of the iceberg. To maintain the wage increment for senior employees, I would have to raise their wages above the new minimum. My monthly payroll would increase by 570 -- and that didn't include the payroll taxes for Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and workman's compensation. For my efforts I received nicely worded form letters about the benefits of the wage increase. When the increase passed, I had to reduce staffing hours. Result I am working harder to earn my money. I already worked six days a week, every week. The staffing cutbacks increased my workload by 15 hours a week. I also cut back on outside services, so I am now mopping my own floors two weeks each month and doing all my own accounting, the weekly laundry and as many of the repairs as I can. When Mr. Clinton signed the wage increase into law, he had by his side a minimum-wage worker who stated that now she did not have to choose between paying her electric bill or her gas bill. The same evening, our local news interviewed a woman who said she would now be able to buy her daughter a compact disk player for graduation. I do not begrudge either of these women their good fortune. But business owners work hard too, and we also have to make tough choices. I suffer from several chronic illnesses, and the wage increase has forced me to cut back on medical care. Money for minimum wage increases has to come from somewhere. Mr. Clinton's proposed increase would raise my annual payroll by 7,200, forcing me to close my doors.

Mr. Greenspan's endorsement, expressed in a letter to House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach R., Iowa, came one day after a top Treasury Department official criticized the bill as a backward step for the banking industry. The Fed chief, however, said passage of the bill would be an historic achievement that would update the increasingly antiquated laws that constrain the development and competitiveness of our financial system. Mr. Greenspan said the bill would remove obsolete barriers that prevent banks, securities and insurance companies from merging. The bill would require any bank that affiliates with other firms to do so within a holding company, over which the Fed would have regulatory authority. The Treasury Department believes that a national bank should be able to conduct any new securities and insurance activities through an affiliate of the bank itself. That corporate structure falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department.

"830984416";"1998-03-18";"Reading recent congressional testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, I had a scary thought He doesn't know any more than I do. By this, I don't mean to compare myself with Greenspan. He's forgotten more about the economy than I'll ever know. Beyond that, the Fed has a staff of 228 economists and is constantly briefed by companies, banks and governments about individual markets and industries. What's sobering is that despite these advantages, Greenspan still seems genuinely baffled by the economy's dazzling performance and its future direction. Precisely. The old adage now seems to apply If you're not confused, you don't understand the situation. On the one hand, the U.S. economy is booming beyond belief. In the past year it has created 3.1 million jobs the unemployment rate 4.6 percent in February hasn't been lower since March 1970. Measured inflation is declining. In the past year the consumer price index has risen only 1.6 percent. Consumer optimism is at lofty heights the Conference Board's confidence index touched 138 in February 1985 equals 100, a level not seen since the late 1960s. On the other hand, the news from Asia isn't getting better. China's economy is slowing Japan may slip into a recession a drop in output. Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund are in a virtual state of war. Including China and India, Asia represents about 30 percent of the world economy. Yet its troubles haven't spoiled American spending or spirits. One explanation is that the benefits of the crisis have come before the costs. The biggest benefit has been lower interest rates, which have triggered a surge in mortgage refinancings. Frightened by Asia's problems, global investors shifted funds into U.S. bonds and mortgage securities. Bond prices rose interest rates dropped. Investors accepted lower interest rates in exchange for more safety. In early 1997, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged almost 8 percent in 1998 they've hovered around 7 percent. Economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates the resulting explosion of mortgage refinancings will total about 400 billion in 1998. On a 120,000 loan, someone going from 8 percent to 7 percent would save nearly 1,000 a year. Lower rates have also sustained a high level of home buying and selling. For 1998, Lereah expects 4.24 million existing homes to be sold, a record. Americans are moving into more appealing homes and, in the process, doing a lot of redecorating and renovating. The second big benefit from Asia has been the plunge in oil prices. Since early 1997 they've dropped from 25 a barrel to 15. The United States now consumes 6.8 billion barrels of oil a year, says economist Michael Canes of the American Petroleum Institute. At the lower prices, consumers would save almost 70 billion. Average gasoline prices have dropped to about 1 a gallon from 1.20 a year ago they could go lower. Part of the gain is a wealth transfer from U.S. oil producers to U.S. consumers, but the gain on our imports -- half our oil use -- is pure windfall. Asia's crisis has cut demand, and the cartel OPEC is falling apart, Canes says. Countries violate their OPEC quotas. Supply rises, demand softens prices fall.";0;1
"830985310";"1998-03-19";"Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act passed two decades ago, the Federal Reserve is required to set targets for growth of the nation's money supply and explain twice yearly to Congress whether it has hit the targets, and if not, why not. In a time of high and rising inflation in the late 1970s, the hope was that the Fed would squeeze money growth, and in the process squeeze out inflation. That's because monetarist economists believed there are strong links between growth of the money supply and growth in the nation's gross domestic product. For a number of years beginning in 1979, the Fed focused tightly on money as it sought to reduce inflation. But then the links between money and current-dollar GDP became highly uncertain in the wake of sweeping changes in U.S. financial markets. As a result, the Fed now announces benchmark ranges for money growth rather than targets, and focuses on controlling overnight interest rates to stabilize the economy. The Shadow Open Market Committee, peopled by monetarists, this week complained the central bank ought to pay more attention to money growth, and warned that if it isn't curbed by interest rate increases there will be a resurgence of inflation. The chart at the right shows part of what the Shadow group is worried about The measure of money known as M2 grew faster last year than the 1 percent to 5 percent range established at the start of the year.

The lower exports helped drive the United States' trade deficit for that month to a record 12 billion. The downturn in sales of American goods to Asia, which economists have anticipated ever since the region's financial markets collapsed last fall, has manifested itself up to now mainly in anecdotes about individual U.S. firms losing business. But with yesterday's report it's undeniable that the effect of the crisis is in the data, said David Hensley, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. Hensley cited exports to South Korea, which plunged to 1.096 billion in January from 1.680 billion the previous month. The level is all the way down to 1993 levels, so we've essentially given back in a few months about four years of export growth, he said. Commerce Secretary William Daley agreed with that diagnosis, saying the crisis has taken its toll on our exports. Excluding Japan and China, sales of U.S. goods in Pacific Rim countries fell about 10 percent, Daley noted, while imports from those countries rose about 7 percent, apparently because of rising demand for goods that have become cheaper due to falling Asian currencies.";0;1

Through Monday, 59.3 billion of new muni bonds were sold this year, up 62 from the 36.7 billion peddled during the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co. The amounts exclude securities maturing in less than one year. Issuance last year was 221.4 billion, up from 185 billion in 1996. Both new issues and refundings of previous deals have climbed, and volume should top 240 billion this year. In short, the supply has been massive, says George Friedlander, Salomon Smith Barney's municipal-bond strategist. Meanwhile, the inexorable climb of the stock market and super-slim bond yields have reduced demand from individual investors for muni bonds despite their tax-free status. Although interest has picked up in recent weeks, prices of muni bonds remain low compared with comparable Treasury issues. Munis have certainly done lousy this month, though short- and intermediatebonds have held up OK, says William Stevens of Montgomery Asset Management. Still, many market participants say munis could represent the best bargains in the bond market.

In 1980, fund investments totaled 100 billion in 12 million accounts today, 5 trillion in 170 million accounts. Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are. The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question. Here is what I want in just-one-fund relatively low risk broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones strong, consistent performance and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds but, curiously, not small-cap funds grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover which boosts tax bills should be relatively low. One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock 1-800-645-6561, which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold.

Mr. Putnam is chairman, chief executive officer and portfolio manager of Fenimore Asset Management, which runs FAM Funds, a family of two mutual funds with about 380 million in assets. The company, named after author James Fenimore Cooper, traces its roots back to the early 1970s, when Mr. Putnam's father sold the family textile business and invested the proceeds in the stock market. Having survived almost 25 years, the company managed private money before opening the first of two mutual funds in 1987 Mr. Putnam says he's laying the groundwork to survive solo the next 25 years, and hopefully longer -- despite a growing consensus that small fund companies can't make it on their own in the highly competitive mutual-fund business. Recently, mutual funds have been a hot commodity in the takeover game. They're commanding billion-dollar price tags amid an unprecedented wave of consolidation, spurred in large part by the theory on Wall Street that fund companies will need to gain size and name recognition to attract the attention of an increasingly fund-savvy investing public. The fund merger wave began several years ago and now even the most independent fund proprietors -- such as Dick Strong of the Strong Funds -- are for the first time weighing their options.

The booming economy and historically low unemployment rates have created recruitment woes for all kinds of businesses, but the hiring headache is especially acute for the retail industry, where the void can be painfully visible to customers. Though the shortage exists nationwide, Washington area retailers are feeling an especially painful pinch. Not only does the retail industry have huge staffing requirements, it's near the bottom of the worker food chain, offering some of the most mundane and lowest-paying jobs. The result is that retailing is losing many potential employees to technology companies and other businesses, which are experiencing their own employee shortages and can lure workers with more money, better benefits and more interesting work. The tech companies are being more creative in who they're willing to hire, taking people and training them in technical skills.

"842613561";"1998-04-29";"WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees. And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by 115 billion in the next five years. The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the strength in the U.S. economy has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller. As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19 of taxable payroll from the 2.23 projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2 of taxable payroll. The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2 a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.";1;0

The massive effort to reprogram millions of computers to recognize dates in the new millennium and, therefore, continue to function, could trim U.S. economic growth by a tenth of a percentage point in each of the next two years, he added. The problem is real and serious, Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward W. Kelley Jr. told a Senate committee, saying the total worldwide repair bill could top 300 billion. Kelley's projections bolster earlier forecasts by corporate analysts. Millions of computers -- some of which are central to running financial markets, air traffic control systems and even elevators in office buildings -- cannot distinguish between the year 1900 and the year 2000 because an old programming practice expressed years as two digits. Unless they are repaired, these systems will process the year 2000 as 00, and the computer will think it's somehow been transported back to 1900, which could cause it to shut down or turn out erroneous data. As the year 2000 gets closer, this bug is attracting high-level attention in both government offices and corporate boardrooms. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now requiring companies with publicly traded shares to disclose how much they're spending to fix the problem and how far along they are.

Now the notion that stocks generate much higher long-term returns than other investments is propelling another momentous shift in public sentiment, which may also end up channeling hundreds of billions of dollars to Wall Street -- from the Social Security program. On one side of the debate is an alliance of conservative Republicans, moderate Democrats and free-market economists who champion privatizing Social Security -- hitching its fortunes to the stock market and possibly transferring back to workers responsibility for managing a portion of what the government now collects in Social Security payroll taxes.

In making their case, the privatizers often brandish data of the sort displayed in the chart at the right.

"842616439";"1998-05-01";"Since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, it has been open season for attacks on the International Monetary Fund. We have been told that the prospect of IMF bailouts caused the crisis and that the IMF's existence, if continued unchanged, will result in many more financial disruptions. Distinguished former cabinet officials, writing on this page, have asked Who Needs the IMF And this newspaper has added its editorial voice to the chorus. Here's a more balanced perspective In a globalized economy, everyone needs the IMF. Without the IMF, the world economy would not become an idealized fantasy of perfectly liquid, completely informed, totally unregulated capital markets. Investors and lenders would still make decisions on the basis of imperfect information, and they would have to take into account the absence of an international lender of last resort. This would be a serious, perhaps devastating, defect. In fact, we got a good sense of life without the IMF in the 1920s and 1930s. The results included widespread competitive devaluation and trade wars in response to balance-of-payments problems, followed by a plunge into global depression and world war. Without a guarantor of international liquidity, many good loans would not be made. Fundamentally sound private investment projects in emerging markets can be dragged down by decisions external to the businesses involved. Even prudent government policies can be waylaid by unforeseeable shocks. Either way, fundamentally good investments will run into temporary liquidity problems. In a world of flexible exchange rates, such temporary problems can be magnified by accompanying drops in the value of the domestic currency. IMF programs finance the adjustment necessary to give these countries and firms time to let their fundamentals pay off. Thus, the IMF is the sovereign nations' credit union. It imposes strict conditions on countries' policies for bridge loans to get through hard times. Only a multilateral institution like the IMF could exert the discipline required without causing an unacceptable affront to a country's sovereignty. The benefits to the borrowing nation are that the adjustment program will be less painful and any resulting contraction less severe. The benefits to the lending countries are not only the availability of those credits to themselves, if and when they need them as even the U.S. has, but a smaller contraction of world demand associated with the borrowing country's adjustment. Some have claimed that these IMF conditions have been misapplied in the Asian crisis, demanding either too much austerity or unjustified structural reform. But IMF conditionality is highly pragmatic. Since the current crisis was not caused in large part by macroeconomic policies, but by financial fragility and lack of transparency, the conditions were designed to respond to those causes. The fund has been ready to renegotiate its programs and to loosen austerity such as the inflation target for South Korea as matters stabilized. There always is room for improvement in individual IMF programs. But attacks on the basic idea of IMF conditionality are thoroughly misguided.";1;0

Today, we received more good news that that strategy is working. The latest economic report shows that in the first quarter of 1998, our economy grew at 4.2 percent. Wages are rising, while inflation remains low. This expansion is not fueled by big government deficits, but by booming business investment.

The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February. The March increase came largely from two of the 10 components that make up the index stock prices and money supply. Both of those measures reflect the strength of financial markets and are considered fairly reliable indicators of the strength of future economic growth, not just of whether the economy will stay out of recession.

After celebrating one of the defining moments of the Cold War by marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, at Tempelhof Airport, Clinton escorted Kohl aboard Air Force One for a short flight to Eisenach, a town in the former Communist part of eastern Germany where they toured a modern car plant built by General Motors Corp. Clinton's visit was the first by a U.S. president to eastern Germany, and it was welcomed by Kohl, who lags far behind his Social Democratic rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls. Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990. Thanks in no small measure to the leadership of your chancellor, Germany today is one nation, in harmony with its neighbors, Clinton told a packed town square, as a beaming Kohl reveled in the praise of his foreign guest. During a foreign policy address Wednesday at Berlin's Schauspielhaus, a famous opera house located on what was once the Communist side of the Berlin Wall, Clinton extolled Kohl's record as chancellor for the past 16 years in terms that sounded like either an endorsement or a political eulogy.";0;1

I was never crazy about this policy. I never attached significance to the number zero. The only thing one could say about zero was that it was 100 billion less than 100 billion and 100 billion more than negative 100 billion. This becomes obvious if you think of all the different plausible ways there are to define and measure budget surpluses and deficits. In the early Reagan years, when the deficit was large, I was not among those most eager to reduce it. Although I believed that the deficit was retarding growth by absorbing private saving that would have been productively invested, I thought that we were a very rich country and had more important things to do than speed up growth. I was a strong supporter of the defense buildup and feared that the deficit argument would be used to restrain it. Grand Goal in Sight I changed my mind recently as the deficit declined this year, the grand goal of zero seems finally achieved. In fact, I came to believe that balancing the budget was not enough and that we needed to get to a surplus. What changed my mind was the ever-clearer prospect that we would run huge deficits in the 21st century as baby boomers claimed their retirement and Medicare benefits. Although I was not one who wanted to maximize future growth, I would not like to see the growth of per capita income turn negative, and I was afraid that would happen if the federal deficit was so large as to absorb all private saving.";1;0

Greenspan, testifying along with Treasury Secretary Robert E.

Until the situation fully stabilizes, we can't really have confidence that the Asian problems won't spread further through the world financial system, he said. Concern about the potential for such a contagion effect, and the increasing drag from the Asian situation on U.S. economic growth, are among the reasons the Fed hasn't raised interest rates this year to head off any possible acceleration of inflation. Fed policymakers last met Tuesday and left rates unchanged. At a March 31 Fed policymaking session, minutes of which were released yesterday, the uncertainty of the ultimate extent of retarding effects for the financial turmoil in Asia was among the reasons given by officials for not raising rates at that time. According to the minutes, the Fed policymakers expressed worry that rapid U.S. economic growth and tight labor markets would eventually lead to higher inflation if they persist.

She argues that it is unnecessary to the local economy, will trash the environment and is a pork-barrel project of Sen. Robert C. Byrd D-W. Va. and a few businessmen. She is wrong on all counts. West Virginia has the third-highest unemployment rate and the second-lowest per capita income among the 50 states. Further, the six counties through which Corridor H will pass have a higher unemployment rate and a lower per capita income than West Virginia as a whole. Nearby counties, which also would be affected by the new road, have similarly dismal statistics. The 18-county region of 325,000 people has one of the poorest performing economies in a poorly performing state. The answer is the improved access for business that only Corridor H can provide. Improving existing two-lane roads, as McKeown suggests, won't work. Industries look for four-lane roads. In addition, the cost of the road improvements that she suggests would come close to equaling the cost of Corridor H. Building the corridor also would reduce the need for improvements to the state's two-land roads because it would divert traffic from them.

"830983648";"1998-05-24";"It is no surprise that Patrick Buchanan has chosen to begin his next campaign for president with a book that blames free trade for all of America's problems. What is surprising is how ordinary, even restrained The Great Betrayal is. For the most part it is no worse than -- indeed is largely based on -- the sort of thing you can read all the time in the Atlantic, the National Interest, and other respectable journals. If Buchanan is prone to logical whoppers, garbled statistics, and warped history, he is no different from many other people who imagine themselves well informed -- although he is unusual in regarding the rising number of working women as a key barometer of America's decline, and perhaps also in concluding that imports, by driving down wages and thus forcing women into the labor force, have directly caused broken homes . . . delinquency, vandalism, crime. Let's get the economics over with quickly. Buchanan believes that thanks to free trade America is squandering its capital abroad that thanks to imports, bank loans, foreign aid, and U.S. defense expenditures overseas, too much of the seed corn of the U.S. economy is now being exported all over the world. Never mind the details though he gets many of them wrong Underlying this whole worldview is an almost ridiculous conceptual confusion. Apparently neither Buchanan nor his fairly extensive brain trust has noticed that the United States is a net importer, not exporter, of capital -- that we are able to run a trade deficit precisely because foreigners are investing more in the United States than we are investing abroad. This is not abstract theory It is a matter of unarguable arithmetic. Once you realize that capital is flowing into the United States, not out of it, just about everything else in Buchanan's argument falls apart -- unless you somehow think that when an American company builds a factory in Mexico, that counts, but when a German company builds a factory here it doesn't. Anyway, it is clear that Buchanan has little patience for close economic analysis His chapters on the subject have a dutiful feel, and one suspects that if he wrote them at all he did little more than transcribe extensive notes prepared by other people. What Buchanan loves -- and I think this is genuine -- is political history. Most of the book is, in fact, not about modern economics but about 19th-century political debates over U.S. trade policy. It has often been said that Buchanan wants to turn the clock back this book certainly reveals him as a man who loves our past, with a passion that verges on the -- gulp -- scholarly. But he does not love all of America's past. In fact, reading the book I found myself wondering where a rather large chunk of our history went -- namely, the great postwar boom. His book skips without a pause from the Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which he correctly identifies as the beginning of our long move toward free trade, to the economic difficulties of the later 1970s. Yet his own chart of U.S. tariff history shows that the great bulk of America's move from protectionism to free trade took place between 1934 and 1960, even though he chooses inexplicably to consider the relatively small tariff reductions since 1967 as defining the free trade era. And surely the prolonged era of unprecedented growth that took place as tariffs declined should at the very least count as evidence that liberalizing trade does not always produce evil effects. Indeed, most people who bemoan the current state of the nation look to the economy of the '50s and '60s as exemplifying the kind of broadly spread prosperity we would like to recapture. Yet Buchanan prefers to pretend that the whole period never happened. What he wants to restore, instead, is the pre-New Deal American economy -- an economy that achieved impressive growth although he may have forgotten that this growth was fueled in large part by massive immigration but also produced widespread misery and vast inequality. Perhaps he loves the distant past too much to find any virtue in times within living memory, or perhaps he dislikes the welfare state too much to acknowledge that Franklin Roosevelt's legacy could have had any positive side. Or perhaps, just perhaps, Buchanan is less populist than he claims to be He may put social justice in his subtitle, but he actually seems to long for the good old days when the gap between rich and poor was even wider than it is today.";0;1
"830984338";"1998-05-24";"Not even the Wizard of Oz slid as swiftly from apparent invincibility to apparent impotence as Indonesia's President Suharto. Now his demise seems readily explainable, as these things always are in retrospect. When his economic miracle morphed into economic crisis, Asia's longest-reigning dictator lost the legitimacy that had masked or excused his regime's many failings while allowing him to buy off potential foes. And when he was forced to kowtow so visibly to the IMF to ensure his nation's survival, he lost the aura of inevitable power that had kept so many of his voiceless subjects living in fear. So what is striking now, in retrospect, is not Suharto's fall -- not the apparently frail old man who emerged with trembling voice from behind the Wizard's curtain -- but rather how, up until the very last moment, the outside world doubted and disparaged Indonesia's People Power. Indonesia was not ready for democracy, was the consensus that only Indonesians chose to ignore Suharto could not fall. Why so many held so misguided a view for so long is worth examining now because many of the same voices can be heard again, touting stability over democratic change. The Clinton administration, to its credit, is no longer among them President Clinton quickly recognized Suharto's resignation as only the first step of a necessary process of democratic change. But many others seem ready to send the unruly students home. Enough upheaval for now, is their message let's get back to the business of healing a crippled economy -- even though Suharto's repressive system remains, so far, unchanged. Their logic is the same as when they were explaining why Suharto could not be replaced. Indonesia is too poor, and its economy too damaged, to manage a political transition now. The opposition is too fragmented, without ideology or program, united only in its disgust for the nepotism and corruption of the Suharto regime. There is no single opposition leader with the stature to unite a nation of so many islands, religions and ethnic groups. Mix in the absence of viable political parties and civic institutions after 32 years of stifling dictatorial rule.

This not only broke Clinton's own pledge to save every penny of the surplus for Social Security.

"830985269";"1998-05-30";"Russia might seem a dubious candidate for an international financial bailout, given its chronic failure to stabilize its economy despite repeated dollops of foreign aid. Yet compared with an economic collapse in, say, Indonesia or South Korea, the prospect of a meltdown in Russia is far more frightening to U.S. officials and international economic policymakers. Therein lies the dilemma confronting the Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund as Russia undergoes one of the most serious bouts of financial turmoil in its recent history. The Russian stock market fell 15.1 percent last week, and is now worth about half what it was at the start of the year. The crisis has aroused alarm that Russia could default on its 145 billion debt to foreigners unless it receives billions of dollars in fresh loans. To critics of Russia's policies, providing such assistance looks like a classic example of throwing good money after bad. But the alternative may be a plunge in the value of the ruble that would devastate the nation's economy, kill public support for the reform program of President Boris Yeltsin and risk social chaos in the world's second-largest nuclear power. As a result, few analysts doubt that the international community will come to Russia's rescue again if the crisis intensifies. The odds are high that Russia will end up back in financial trouble even if it gets new loans, but nobody's going to let Russia go down the tubes, said Clifford Gaddy, an expert in the Russian economy at the Brookings Institution. It's always going to be bailed out somehow. The Russians have 30,000 nuclear weapons, and that's 30,000 reasons why they won't be allowed to go under.";0;1

"842613690";"1998-06-03";"According to conventional wisdom among economists and policy makers, Americans do not save enough. The suggested remedies include tax incentives for saving and policies ensuring that government programs, such as Social Security, do not discourage saving. But Americans save more than many believe, and in any case, future generations will be better off than the current ones even if saving does not increase. It is true that by official measures, U.S. net national saving has been low, by both historical and international standards. For a decade at least, the high measured saving rates in Japan were cited to explain why Japanese economic growth was so much greater than the U.S.'s. Japan still has a higher saving rate, but its growth has stopped. Most developed economies would be envious of the U.S.'s 4 economic growth rate and its unemployment rate of less than 5. It seems a bad bargain to change places with Japan, or any of the other nations with purportedly higher saving rates. But by appropriate measures, the U.S. saving rate is not really so low. The official measure of net national saving begins with gross saving, which has been rising. Gross saving reached 17.3 of gross domestic product in 1997. To calculate the net saving, usually viewed as national saving, one must subtract depreciation or consumption of fixed capital. This brings the rate of net national saving down to 555 billion, or 6.5 of GDP. That 555 billion would add about 2.8 to the current net stock of tangible capital, public and private. Thus it implies a growth in capital somewhat higher than commonly forecast long-run growth rate of the economy. Even this net rate might not be an adequate measure of growth in a period of rapid technological advance. The depreciated capital might be replaced by more productive new capital, so that even without adding to the measure of net capital stock the capacity for growth would increase. A better perspective could be gained by looking at real gross domestic investment, private and public. That total, financed in part by foreign net investment equal to 2 of our GDP, comes to 19.5 of GDP.

A sale of that scale would be the largest strategic move in the history of Textron, a conglomerate based in Providence, R.I., that makes Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters and has other operations in automotive and industrial-fastener manufacturing. People familiar with Textron's deliberations say that the company could decide to keep Avco after the review, but has been tempted by prices paid for other consumer loan companies recently, and has hired investment bankers Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P.

A sale of Avco would likely be followed by stepped-up acquisitions by Textron, which has purchased over 30 companies since 1992.

The unemployment rate stayed at its 28-year low of 4.3 of the work force in May, suggesting that April's drop was no aberration. The economy added 296,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. For the past six months, job gains have averaged 257,000 a month and the labor market has been taut. Wage gains were also healthy during May. Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased four cents to a seasonally adjusted 12.73. Average weekly earnings increased 0.9 to 441.73. Average weekly earnings and average hourly earnings have both risen 4.3 during the past year -- without many signs of inflationary pressures. The economy, though slowing from the 4.8 gross-domestic-product growth rate posted in the first quarter, still continues to generate jobs. Certainly, the Asian financial crisis has had an effect. The manufacturing sector has slowed its rate of growth in the second quarter, and manufacturing jobs declined 26,000 last month, the third drop in the past four months. Those declines, however, were offset by the brisk-paced service sector, which accounted for all of May's job gains. Business services, retail trade and financial sectors all boosted their payrolls in May. This shows that overall we can weather shifts in the economy, said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who used the manufacturing fall-off to underscore the importance of the International Monetary Fund's proposed Asian relief package.

The jobless figures were leaked prior to yesterday's official release. As early as Friday, Mr. Kohl cheered the numbers, saying the unemployment rate declined to 10.9 in May from 11.4 in April. Economists, however, dismissed the notion of inflationary dangers and any calls for the German central bank to raise rates pre-emptively at today's policy-setting central bank council. They said the link between employment and inflation in the U.S. doesn't apply in Germany, because the rate of unemployment in the U.S. is much lower than in Germany, and close to its so-called natural rate, where it poses inflationary pressure.

These pension plans, once a drag on earnings, are boosting the financial performance of many of the country's best-known companies. The pension-fund bubble stems from the arcane accounting rules that govern the more than 1 trillion in private pensions. Under those rules, companies make assumptions about how much they will earn on their pension assets, how much they will have to pay out to future retirees and the future level of interest rates. But what has been happening during the long bull market is that those assumptions have proved too conservative -- and the funds have swollen far beyond expectations as stock market returns have outpaced historical trends. The excess, filtered through many layers of accounting, is dribbling down to the bottom line. And that's giving an extra boost to corporate profits at a time when earnings are being squeezed from lack of pricing power and rising wage pressures. Some companies are siphoning off some of the pension surplus to pay for other corporate needs, such as early-retirement plans, retiree health benefits and even merger financing. For many businesses, the gain is twofold Their plans are so flush they are being spared from having to make new annual contributions, and they are earning income from the excess that has built up throughout the stock market's rise.";0;1

Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, who announced the stimulus package in a television address to the territory's 7 million residents, said the regional economic meltdown that began a year ago has proven more devastating than anything we had known before. The effects of the turmoil are more serious and far-reaching than we have anticipated, Tung said. He cited high interest rates, a debilitating credit crunch, the highest unemployment rate in 15 years, collapsing stock and property markets and a tourist industry he said was shrinking. All Hong Kong assets have been devalued and shrunk to a large extent within a few months, Tung said in his most somber assessment yet of the territory's economic straits. Every sign points to the fact that negative economic growth will likely continue in the second quarter. The unemployment rate will probably continue to rise, and the economic situation for the second half of the year is hardly optimistic. Tung's bleak analysis, and the announcement of the stimulus package, was yet another sign of the depth and severity of the regionwide meltdown. Once touted as a miracle model of growth and development, East Asia has in the course of just 12 months come to be identified as a region with millions of new unemployed people, bankrupt banks, piles of bad debt and a fraying social fabric. Hong Kong was once thought to be an island of financial stability amid the regional turmoil. Its currency is firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar, so the territory avoided the round of devaluations that swept through Asia last year. Its banks are generally considered healthier than elsewhere. And its now-departed British colonialists left behind an effective legal system and a professional civil service that have largely spared Hong Kong from the problems of corruption and nepotism that are common across the region.

Production and exports have been disrupted, unemployment is increasing, the banks are paralyzed, and food prices are rising, Mr. Neiss said. It's no wonder the rupiah rate has depreciated. Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hailed the new pact between Jakarta and suggested the U.S. will help Indonesia get the money it needs both from international financial institutions and other countries he wasn't specific. The success of the IMF program, he added, depends on Indonesia's ability to sustain both economic and political reforms.

The rupiah is targeted to end the year at 10,000 against the U.S. dollar, substantially stronger than its Thursday close of 14,700. However, many currency analysts fear that the rupiah could weaken in the months ahead, given social and political concerns. All of this raises the possibility that Indonesia's budget deficit could actually exceed the target of 8.5 of GDP.

Whatever the cause, more than 120,000 women in this country last year went under the knife to increase the size of their breasts for cosmetic purposes, the society says. At its peak around 1990, breast augmentation was the No. 1 form of cosmetic surgery, with about 125,000 to 150,000 procedures performed annually in the U.S., according to implant manufacturer Inamed Corp., of Las Vegas, one of two companies in the U.S. that still make breast implants. But then came questions about whether silicone implants might somehow trigger diseases such as lupus, arthritis or even cancer. In 1992, the year the FDA ban went into effect, the number of breast-implant procedures plummeted to 32,000. Although silicone breast-implants are still banned for cosmetic purposes in the U.S., some of the safety concerns surrounding them have been put to rest. In fact, even in this country, silicone is used for penile and testicular implants. Still, plastic surgeons and implant makers are touting breast implants filled with saline-water as a safer, more natural and more comfortable alternative to silicone. Saline implants now are used in more than 90 of all breast-enlargement procedures. It isn't as if saline-implant surgery is risk-free Common complications can include deflation of the implant, hardening of the scar tissue around the breast, and decreased sensation of the breast. After surgery, there may be bleeding, pain and infection. There may also be complications from anesthesia, including death.";1;0

The Midwest and Texas are two likely beneficiaries of the farm aid, which sailed through on a voice vote and the endorsement of the White House. After days of pounding by Democrats on a growing economic crisis in the Farm Belt, Republican senators appeared to have little will to resist. Even on the food-safety initiative, the GOP split almost evenly in support of the White House's position. Sen. Thad Cochran R., Miss., the bill's manager, joined in backing the amendment, adding 66 million for the food-safety program. Most of the money would go to programs within the Food and Drug Administration, and together with what was already in the bill, the White House will get a total of 68 million, or about three-quarters of its request. Final Senate passage last night came as the House narrowly approved a 26.6 billion Treasury bill after a seesaw battle driven by partisan politics -- and the always divisive issue of abortion. Attached to the measure is a precedent-setting provision requiring that health-insurance plans for federal employees provide contraceptive coverage. Antiabortionists have attached similar riders to ban abortion coverage, and the new provision is a major victory for women's rights groups. Beyond the abortion debate, the proposal touches on the issue of gender discrimination in health insurance. Young single women are often forced to bear the price of birth control, and if the contraceptives requirement is enacted for federal-employee health plans, it could have an influence on the entire health-insurance industry.";1;0

"842614934";"1998-07-22";"The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1 or 2. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable. Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies. Why does this matter to us The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of 15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles. The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly. The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by. International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home.";1;0

At issue was Shays-Meehan language that would begin federal regulation of political advertising, including TV and radio attack ads, that interest groups sponsor to help or hurt a specific candidate. Shays-Meehan would bring these issue advocacy ads under the spending and disclosure requirements that govern the candidates' own ads. With this vote, the House defeated an amendment that sought to soften the proposed new curbs on independently financed issue ads. ABORTION For-276Against-150 The House passed a bill making it a federal crime to transport a minor to another state for an abortion, in order to avoid parental consent or notification laws in the girl's home state. The bill does not apply when the abortion is necessary to save the girl's life, and it exempts parents from prosecution. A yes vote was to pass the bill. GUN DEALERS For-122Against-301 The House rejected an amendment to prevent 2 million from being paid to gun importers as compensation for inventory they lost when President Clinton recently banned the importation of certain assault weapons. The weapons were in transit to the U.S. dealers at the time of the April 6, 1998, ban. This vote occurred during debate on the Treasury Department's fiscal 1999 spending bill.

This principle needs to be applied in explaining why the Canadian dollar has been dropping like a rock. The mystery here is that the Bank of Canada seems to be doing everything right, producing exemplary consumer price performance. But the loonie -- named for the loon on the face of the dollar coin -- hovers at 1.50 to the U.S. dollar instead of the 1.25 to the U.S. dollar that a consumer price-based measure of Purchasing Power Parity PPP, or the relative purchasing power of the two currencies, would suggest. The reward for monetary discipline should have been a strong Canadian dollar. Instead the legacy of inflation fighting by former central bank governor John Crow is a currency that seems to have no bottom. But while the Bank of Canada sticks to a strict anti-inflation diet, the Canadian government continues to consume a large share of the fruits of the country's productive capacity through a punishingly high tax rate. And this explains much of the loonie's loss of value. Some have argued that it is incorrect to measure PPP using the different changes in consumer prices between the U.S. and Canada. Producer prices are the main reflectors of international competitiveness, and if that measure of inflation is used the Canadian dollar's plight is slightly less puzzling. However, another argument has been advanced by WorldInvest International of London and Vancouver. It argues the PPP based on unit labor costs in manufacturing should be used to discover the Canadian dollar's theoretical value. WorldInvest notes that during the last 20 years unit labor costs have risen 109 in Canada versus 57 in the U.S. Correspondingly, the unit labor cost PPP of the U.S. dollar has moved from C1.08 to C1.40.";1;0

"842615616";"1998-08-14";"There is little doubt that the economic crisis now gripping East Asia is the most severe shock to the global economy since the end of the Cold War. But it would be wrong to attribute the recent weakness on Wall Street to the crisis. There is no reason for the Asian crisis to depress the growth rate of the U.S. economy. Instead, it is likely to change the sectoral composition of growth within the economy. The crisis will set the stage for poor performance in companies producing tradable goods, but it will also create opportunities for profit in companies catering to domestic consumption. The data on the U.S. gross domestic product for the first half of 1998 illustrate how the crisis has changed the U.S. economy's growth mix. There was an unprecedented expansion of the trade deficit, to 252.9 billion during the second quarter of 1998 from 149 billion during the fourth quarter of 1997. This reduced real annual GDP growth by about 2.4 during the first half of 1998. But total annual output growth still averaged about 3.5 because domestic demand grew at a 6.5 annual rate compared with 2.4 during the fourth quarter of 1997. This upsurge was not a lucky accident, but the result of three positive side effects the crisis has had on the U.S. economy. First, the risk of further financial collapse in Asia and elsewhere has deterred the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to slow the growth of domestic spending. As a result, the U.S. economy is enjoying higher growth rates for home building, commercial construction and retail sales than it would have without the Asian crisis. Second, increased foreign demand for American equities and other U.S. financial assets has helped the U.S. withstand the Asia trade shock. The Asia crisis created a surplus pool of global liquidity that has driven U.S. equity prices to unprecedented levels. Foreign investors purchased U.S. equities at an annual rate exceeding 100 billion during the first quarter of 1998, compared with 66 billion during the whole of 1997. The buoyancy of the equity market has boosted household wealth while sending the household savings rate down to only 0.6 during the second quarter, from 2.6 one year ago.";1;0

The intervention, a retreat from the city's legendary commitment to free markets, is causing some politicians and investors to ask whether officials were aiding the interests of Hong Kong's corporate barons as the economy heads into deep recession. Many of the stocks purchased by the government in Friday's intervention were in companies controlled by big developers, many of them key constituent stocks of the blue-chip Hang Seng index. The government said its stock purchases were meant to reflect the broad market, and were aimed at hurting financial speculators who were selling stocks and futures as a way of pressuring the Hong Kong dollar lower.

Imports fell to an adjusted 90.32 billion in June from 92.12 billion in May. Exports in June slipped to 54.61 billion from 54.72 billion. Underlying these figures is an across-the-board weakness in U.S. exports stemming from the impact of economic turmoil in Asia and some price cutting by U.S. companies acting to remain competitive. U.S. shipments to the Pacific Rim countries, for example, fell to 13.59 billion in June from 17 billion in June 1997. That continued a recent downward trend in exports to the region. The year-over-year numbers are the most accurate measure of the trend, as these figures aren't seasonally adjusted. But U.S. export weakness spreads beyond Asia, says David Levy, director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economic Institute, Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Based on a 12-month moving average, he calculates U.S. exports to Europe essentially have been flat since March. Mr. Levy blames the strong U.S. dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, and intense competition from Asian exporters.";1;0

In a separate report earlier in the week, the Labor Department said the number of American workers laid off from 1995 to 1997 dropped sharply from the prior three-year period. A total of 3.6 million workers were displaced, according to the government's biannual survey, down nearly 15 from 1993-95. The study includes data from 1995 in both time periods. The study, reported in yesterday's New York Times, also found that getting laid off caused less trouble for workers as the economy improved. About three-fourths of people who lost jobs from 1995-97 found new jobs fairly quickly, a slight improvement over 1993-95. More than half of those who found new jobs earned as much or more than they had in their earlier jobs, a seven-percentage-point improvement over 1993-95. And while one in four laid-off workers suffered an income drop of 20 or more when they were re-employed, that was down from the one-third who saw such a decline in 1993-95.";1;0

Back then, U.S. wholesale prices dropped 32 as demand nose-dived in the face of bankruptcies, widespread unemployment and massive pay cuts. Today we have financial crises aplenty in Asia, but they are unlikely to spread to the West. In the U.S., the long series of sectoral financial problems -- ranging from the farm-belt collapse in the early 1980s to difficulties related to the defense cutbacks of the early 1990s -- are behind us. Demand will probably not collapse in the West, even though there are some demand-reducing deflationary forces at work in the world. The Cold War is over, and the history of U.S. inflation is the history of wars. Since 1749, prices have risen at double-digit annual rates in wartime, but have fallen by more than 1 a year on average in peacetime. This isn't surprising, since the government is the only economic sector with enough financial credibility to outspend its revenues vastly and create excess demand for any length of time. Wars on poverty are similarly inflationary, but the passage of welfare reform suggests that Washington is serious about cutting nondefense spending. Government spending in Europe is hemmed in by the Maastricht requirements for deficits and debts. And despite eight years of a deflationary depression, Japan remains unwilling to enact major tax cuts for fear of the budgetary consequences. These are not the only deflationary forces at work. The Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to fight yesterday's war against inflation. Productivity-enhancing and cost-cutting restructuring prevails in this country and is spreading to Europe and Japan. Deregulation is bringing prices down. The continuing strength of the U.S. dollar encourages imports at lower costs, thereby forcing domestic competitors to reduce their selling prices. Even more significant are deflationary forces that increase supply. Global sourcing is mushrooming low-cost supplies, and not just of goods. Software engineers in India are working for U.S. firms at 20 of what Americans cost. The shift in both Russia and especially China from the command economy model to unbridled, buccaneer capitalism is also creating huge new sources of supply. The collapsed Asian economies, including Japan, desperately want to increase exports to employ their citizens and earn hard currency to service their huge foreign debts. Include booming high-tech industries, and global supplies of almost everything will surge while prices will necessarily fall.";1;0

That marked its lowest close since 1986. The move was the latest slip in the index's year-long 39.57-point fall from 237.69, signaling commodity markets' two-year bear market may be picking up steam rather than abating. The Goldman Sachs index of spot commodity prices also slipped 1.41 to 139.6070, its lowest level since 1977. Most industry observers don't believe commodity prices will recover any time soon.

There's plenty of supply of everything and no demand. Where it bottoms out could be anyone's guess. And the free fall could have implications for other areas of the economy as well. Robert Hafer, managing director at BridgeCRB, said the CRB traditionally is an advance indicator of what conditions will be like in six to 12 months. He says if deflation spreads, it will show up next in producer prices and then consumer prices. That, he said, could necessitate a cut in interest rates.

Although some polls indicate he has narrowed the gap with Social Democratic rival Gerhard Schroeder to as little as 3 percentage points, the hostility Kohl encounters at nearly every stop in the east suggests he is making no headway in recapturing the allegiance of Germany's most fickle swing voters. Four years ago, Kohl came from 18 points down to win reelection with the help of an avalanche of votes from easterners still grateful to the father of German unity for liberating them from the bleak repression they endured under the Communist authorities of the German Democratic Republic. The republic collapsed in 1990 along with other Soviet-backed Communist regimes, and its five regions, along with Berlin, were folded into the Federal Republic of Germany. But rampant despair over widespread joblessness and embittered dismay with capitalist society have compelled many easterners to turn against Kohl with a vengeance. Many politicians and commentators now believe Kohl's Christian Democrats could tumble to third place in the east, behind Schroeder's Social Democrats and the former Communists known as the Party of Democratic Socialism.";0;1

Both plans allow home buyers to qualify for interest rates below prevailing market levels. Both work especially well for jumbo loan borrowers -- those seeking mortgages of more than 227,000 -- and for buyers who know they're likely to sell or move sometime in the coming four to five years. But both require you to strike a bargain of sorts with your lender. You've got to give up something to get the discount rate. The first oldie-but-goodie making a comeback is the prepayment penalty plan. In exchange for a fixed 30-year interest rate that's about 0.25 percent less than the regular rate, you agree not to refinance during the next 60 months. After that, you're free to do whatever you want. And during those first 60 months, you are free to pay off the mortgage loan without penalty if you move or sell the house. But if you prepay the mortgage balance simply to refinance with another lender, you get hit with a penalty, the size of which varies according to state law. In California, for example, the prepayment penalty can't exceed 80 percent of six months' interest. In other states, where such prepayment penalties are subject to different statutory restrictions, the penalty may be different, or not permitted at all.";0;1

The added uncertainty about where the world economy is headed and the likelihood the crisis will be a drag on U.S. growth, however, has virtually eliminated pressure on the Fed to raise rates to keep U.S. inflation low, the officials said. William Poole, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who dissented in favor of a rate increase at a Fed policymaking session in May, said he no longer is pushing for higher rates. None of the other officials, including Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who are here for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's annual economic conference, would speak for attribution. But several of the 14 policymakers here agreed that damage to the economies of nations such as Brazil, Mexico and Canada from sharply higher interest rates and falling stock prices means a weaker world economy and downward pressure on prices for many goods and services. Like the turmoil that began in Asian countries last year, the latest developments will be a serious drag on U.S. growth by lowering demand for U.S. exports, particularly in Latin America. At the same time, slower growth around the world and falling prices for many products, especially basic commodities such as oil and copper, and the rising value of the dollar, will keep the cost of U.S. imports falling.

An analysis of household income from 1969 to 1996 showed a 57 percent rise in real median income for married couples over age 65, dwarfing the 6.3 percent increase for all households. Among elderly people living alone, incomes went up even more -- 63 percent. The improvements can be traced largely to increases in Social Security benefits and pensions, but also reflect a generation that enjoyed the combined effect of the G.I. Bill that gave many more college educations, a booming real estate market and the entry of more women into the labor force. These changes, said Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, have meant light-years of difference for that whole generation. In fact, the result has been to create a very different profile of retirement and aging. As late as the 1960s, many elderly ended up in county homes for the aged, a bed of last resort for those without income, family or health care coverage. Now, most older Americans are able to either live at home or, in a small but growing number of cases, move into retirement communities and assisted living facilities that enable them to live more active lives.";0;1

That has been the lesson of recent experience, but it hasn't worked out that way in the first two days of this week, when sharp declines in U.S. equity prices were followed by surprising gains in Japanese shares. Yesterday, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose 261.74 points, or 1.8, to close at 14369.63. On Monday, the Nikkei gained 192.26 points, recovering from a 12-year low of 13915.63 that it hit Friday. The yen strengthened against the dollar to 138.20 yen per dollar in late Tokyo trading, up from 141.50 yen Monday. Broad movements in the New York and Tokyo markets have recently been closely linked, as investors have started treating Japan's biggest blue-chip exporters much the same way they do their U.S. counterparts. So the fact that Japanese stocks were able to shrug off the 6.37 drop in New York on Monday raised eyebrows on trading floors across the nation and fueled speculation that the government had stepped in to support the market -- something that politicians from Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on down have promised not to do. There was no firm evidence that the government had intervened in the market, however. Although some traders interpreted buying by public pension funds as a sign of government support, other analysts said it was more likely that those pension funds were simply engaged in normal buying. While public pension funds have helped the government support the market in the past, these days they are burdened with huge unfunded liabilities and are desperately trying to earn better returns, making them unlikely proxies for a government interested in bolstering a sagging market. Instead, strategists think that fresh interest in Japanese shares, which many expect to be short-lived, mainly reflects a renewed caution among Japanese investors who are spooked by the turmoil in U.S. and European stock markets and willing, at least for now, to give domestic shares a second look. Some analysts suggested that the market rise also could be the result of hopes that the U.S. will cut interest rates in order to counter the effects of the U.S. stockmarket decline.

They signify instead a gathering fear that the global economy is drifting toward a dangerous slump, driven by forces that world leaders only vaguely understand and seem powerless to affect. Even those supposed titans of global finance -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- give little hint publicly that they grasp the threat or know what to do about it. This is no longer a minor Asian crisis. Japan's recession is its worst since World War II. Latin America's economies are slowing. Mexico's economy -- which had been growing 4 to 5 percent -- will be lucky to grow 2 percent next year, says economist Desmond Lachman of Salomon Smith Barney. Russia's depression hurts its Eastern European trading partners. China is slowing. Together, these areas represent almost half the world economy's output. The United States and Europe, with another 40 percent of global gross domestic product GDP, cannot easily escape the fallout. Given today's prosperity, Americans are naturally disbelieving. Unemployment is 4.5 percent. Inflation barely exists. Exports -- the sector directly affected by the global slump -- are only 12 percent of U.S. GDP. But economists and others often blunder by projecting the present into the future. America's prosperity is precarious precisely because things can't get better they could easily get worse. How The economic expansion began in 1991. Americans have already bought lots of cars, computers and clothes. Consumer debt including home loans is high. In the first half of 1998, the personal savings rate was less than one percent. Until recently, the jubilant stock market made Americans feel wealthier. They are spending some of their stock profits since 1992, annual realized capital gains have roughly tripled. Now, lower stock prices could dampen confidence and consumer spending, which is two-thirds of GDP. Exports are already weakening rising imports further imperil domestic production. Why, then, would companies continue to increase investment 11 percent of GDP A recession is clearly possible. And a U.S. slump would compound everyone else's problems. The United States is the world's largest importer, and other countries -- from South Korea to Brazil -- need to export to recover. Lower interest rates would improve the outlook. Economist Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Relations rightly says that the Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank should cut rates by half a percentage point. Lower rates would ease debt burdens and help sustain consumer spending and home-buying.";0;1

With passengers scrambling for scarce seats on other carriers and the Montreal company losing millions of dollars for every day the strike lasts, some analysts said they expect the stoppage to end within days. Spokesmen for Air Canada and its pilots' union said yesterday they were prepared to return to the bargaining table quickly, though further talks hadn't yet been scheduled. As with the Northwest Airlines strike in the U.S., the Air Canada dispute stems from labor concessions in the early 1990s. The Air Canada pilots argue that a pay cut they took in 1993, combined with subsequent productivity increases, helped the carrier post a record profit last year. The pilots also claim they are paid 30 to 50 less than pilots for major U.S. carriers.

In some ways, the end of this century resembles the end of the last one. Corporations have regained the kind of unfair advantages over working people that they have not enjoyed for nearly 100 years. And with this, we find many of the darker impulses of the Gilded Age alive and well among today's entrepreneurs -- specifically, the willingness to roll over working people who seem powerless. In the 1990s, Americans are working harder than ever -- and they've got the stress to show for it. Millions now know what it's like to work uncompensated overtime in understaffed offices, or to work two jobs or to go without vacations and health insurance. For all this extra productivity that's been squeezed out of them in today's lean and mean workplace, the average American worker today earns less, works longer hours and spends less time with family. Workers kept their side of the bargain in making America more competitive again, but the gains they won were not equally shared. And this inequality is going to continue until workers become as organized as they did in the labor movement's prime. About 16 million American workers are represented by unions today. That's down 24.5 percent since 1980, at a time when our work force approaching 137 million is at an all-time high. Some say the reason is that manufacturing jobs have gone overseas. But the United States has more manufacturing jobs today than ever before -- the jobs just have moved south and west, to states where workers are not organized.

"830982411";"1998-09-16";"Anyone who questions whether we are living in a global economy needs to reflect carefully on the financial turmoil of the past few weeks. We can no longer escape the issue of how to manage in a world in which economic currents have no frontiers but our instruments to deal with them do. The International Monetary Fund lies at the center of this storm. It is the only financial institution that has some semblance of global influence. The IMF, however, is the subject of considerable controversy. The traditional approach of the IMF is to lay the foundation for healthy economic growth by restraining government intervention in the economies, ensuring sound currencies and encouraging open markets. Its policies have been a major factor in spurring unprecedented changes in the global economy. Current efforts to stabilize the Asian economies, however, are far different and more complex. Gone is the luxury of an exuberant economic environment. Commodity prices are plummeting. Interest rates in the affected countries are soaring, crippling banks and bankrupting business. Manufacturing plants throughout Asia have idle excess capacity. Unemployment is rising sharply. Devaluations and the fall of capital markets have drained substantial liquidity from global markets. The losses on the U.S. stock market alone since July are equivalent to the total annual GDP of all of the Latin American nations combined. Governments cannot balance budgets in the face of collapsing tax receipts, impeding their capacity to stimulate their economies. The problem for the IMF, however, is that the issue of corruption that got us into this predicament is just as real. As we see in Russia and many countries of Asia, this is the most pernicious contagion that has infected many banks and commercial enterprises. The result has been illicit enrichment and misallocation of resources, which taxpayers the world over are now being asked to pay. This will not do. The deep concerns about corruption reflected in the debate in Congress about IMF funding have to be addressed in formulating new policies. On the positive side, strong U.S. and European economies still exert considerable pull to lift the faltering economies of the developing world. The countries of Asia are now yielding large current-account surpluses, which could help them restore their economies if they have access to bridge capital. The issue is how to restore global confidence while not abetting corrupt practices or rewarding ill-considered lending.";0;1

And in the past couple of years, something else has grabbed her by the heart Religion and the Lord, Ms. Rapcan says, clasping her hands together. Twice a week, she drives more than an hour to church. Last week, the sermon was on forgiveness. The week before, it was about seeing the good in everyone. Ms. Rapcan says she gets a lot more out of those messages than out of anything politicians can do for her. Apparently, she is one of many who place politics far down on the list of things that influence their lives.

After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain. The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market, says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market. But too often, Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- just another bond fund with a higher yield. In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground. That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0 return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7 decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index.

Back in Washington, in the offices of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, the view is more opaque. Here, after recently acknowledging that American prosperity could be threatened by the escalating global financial crisis, Greenspan is weighing whether short-term interest rates should be reduced when Fed policymakers meet in 10 days. We're asking the chairman to be proactive, said Laney, who heads the National Association of Manufacturers' small and medium-size business subcommittee. The NAM is among a group of business interests from Wall Street to Main Street clamoring for an immediate cut in interest rates to bolster the U.S. economy and help combat a global economic slowdown. Businesses are calling for lower rates for a variety of reasons -- some of which openly are in self-interest. Some argue that cutting the cost of consumer and business borrowing would stimulate a cooling U.S. economy, and counterbalance falling foreign demand for U.S. goods. Others believe easier credit would provide a crucial psychological boost to skittish financial markets on Wall Street and overseas. It's the domino effect, said Laney, whose company makes window casings for heavy trucks and buses. Laney reasons that if shipments to Asia are slumping, there will be less demand for trucks to carry U.S.-made goods to and from the ports -- and eventually less need for Laney's products.";0;1

It won't make anyone with devalued rubles feel better, but the economic crisis in Russia has been surprisingly easy on Steptoe & Johnson and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, both of which have Moscow outposts. The 13-lawyer Moscow office of Akin, Gump reports that its business mix has changed, without drastic financial consequences. Michael Waller, the managing partner there, said in a very long-distance phone interview that before the crisis the firm's capital markets lawyers were its main moneymakers. Those lawyers are basically idle now, but bankruptcy attorneys are more than picking up the slack. In fact, while the rest of the country, and many law firms in Moscow, are laying off workers, Akin Gump hired a new lawyer a few weeks ago. You have to structure your business so that you can provide services in a restructuring period as well as an expansion period, Waller said, predicting that revenue for the year will match last year's numbers. We were incredibly busy for the first six or seven months of the year, and now we're just normally busy.

A positive mental attitude, optimism and self-confidence are good attributes, says Steven Thorley, a finance professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management in Provo, Utah. But in the financial world, they just don't work. You're not interacting with people. You're interacting with prices. They don't care how you feel that day. In general, overconfidence is a negative. Overconfident investors tend to trade too much and tend to bet too heavily on particular stocks or market sectors, says Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University in California. These investors think they know more than they really do, and they buy and sell stocks on this knowledge. Trading volume is higher after a period of high returns, Mr. Statman says.

Until this summer, Turkish officials had been predicting that the country would escape the economic contagion spreading from Southeast Asia. As of mid-year, the economy had enjoyed three years of steady growth, and Yilmaz's anti-inflation policies had won the approval of the International Monetary Fund and brought foreign investors flocking. But Russia's festering economic problems already had begun to erode Turkey's strong base, and the recent Russian financial collapse and the free fall of the ruble have sent shock waves southward. According to recently released government figures, Turkey's official trade with Russia declined 15 percent in the first half of this year. The unofficial export of textiles and other goods to Russia and other former Soviet Bloc countries, which earned the Turks around 8.5 billion in foreign exchange two years ago, is expected to bring in little more than 4 billion in 1998. Overall, Turkey has seen its trade deficit grow to 7.5 billion in the first half of this year. In addition, internal commerce is undergoing a cyclical slowdown, analysts say.

We are exploring . . . whether these funds that can pose a threat to the economic system or to the bank deposit insurance system should have more federal oversight, said Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on capital markets and securities. Wednesday, at the urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a group of 14 banks and securities firms agreed to provide more than 3.5 billion to rescue Greenwich, Conn.-based Long-Term Capital Management L.P. after fears rose that its demise would send a shock wave through the global economy. The once highflying fund faced losses on about 100 billion in bets it had made in financial markets around the world. Baker and the staff of other lawmakers suggested that the question of regulating this type of funds, known as hedge funds, could affect the progress of pending legislation to revamp 65-year-old banking and securities laws. Unlike most other financial companies, operators of hedge funds answer to no oversight institution, either state or federal, even though the funds make speculative, multibillion-dollar bets with borrowed money in markets all over the world. As recently as last week, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he had no problem with that arrangement. Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those who lend the money, Greenspan said in response to a question by Baker during testimony before the House Banking Committee.

People here don't always like our message, he sighed. They don't want Germany to be like America. That is an assessment I heard throughout Germany in the run-up to the election. Alarming rates of unemployment and signs that the country is losing its competitive edge have convinced the German people that the welfarist social market economy that has served them since the end of World War II is seriously ill. But aside from the 6 to 7 of voters who regularly back the FDP, there is little support for a wholesale change of the old system. It is said that the laissez-faire capitalism that has fueled growth in the U.S. is somehow un-German and un-European, a risky experiment with what is perceived to be a uniquely American culture of slums, crime and rampant individualism. That mentality -- the desire for change, but only a bit of it -- explains the enormous appeal of Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's new chancellor-elect. He speaks in lofty terms of the future, but the success of his message is in its implication that Germany can reclaim a past when the welfare state seemed to work. The voters screamed for change, but all they really wanted is the promise of a more functional status quo. This is a conservative country with conservative attitudes, says Dieter Roth, a pollster with Forschungsgruppe Wahlen in Mannheim.

What does this all mean for the future of the world's third-largest economy Despite Mr. Schroeder's claims, German socialism has seen its last days. Tanglesome regulations, one of the world's heaviest tax burdens and the most expensive labor force in the Western world are eroding the competitiveness of German corporations.

With financial chaos rolling over East Asia and Russia, and threatening Brazil as well, the U.S. put forth a wish list that sharpens some old tools and offers some new initiatives, but adds no new money to the international response to the crisis beyond already-requested funding.

The IMF proposal, however, is likely to prove the most controversial element of the U.S. initiative.

But with the exception of one shooting star -- South Carolina -- the Southeast's other five states are slowly losing their luster. Just last quarter, the panel of economists predicted growth of 4 for the six-state region.";1;0

Having set themselves up in 1995, the Congressional leadership wakes up at night shaking with fear that President Clinton will veto a bill to keep the government open, then blame them for closing the government. With Asian economies toppling and the U.S. financial boom topping out, Republicans are particularly worried about getting tagged for an economic crisis unless they give Mr. Clinton anything he asks. The President lectured them again when speaking at the IMF meeting this week They should pay the 18 billion because there is no excuse for refusing to supply the fire department with water while the fire is burning. Before you pour liquid on a raging fire, we might suggest, make sure it doesn't smell like gasoline. On the record of the past 15 months of crisis, the IMF doesn't look like much of a fireman. More of an arsonist. Back in March 1997, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus gave a speech predicting for Asia at worst a cyclical correction that is not expected to be deep or prolonged. Mr. Camdessus was at that point already urging Thailand to devalue -- apparently clueless about the trouble that would come of it. The IMF went on to urge the devaluations that dragged down South Korea, wrecked Indonesia and set off shock waves that -- amplified by Russia -- now threaten Brazil. To combat this, the IMF began by pouring 18 billion into Thailand, and said the worst was over. Then the Fund led a 43 billion bailout for Indonesia and said all would be well. There followed 57 billion for South Korea, 23 billion for Russia. That comes to 141 billion. The fund is now arranging a similar 30 billion experience for Brazil, bringing recent IMF crisis-dousing to 171 billion. Yet clearly the world is in worse shape than when the Fund back in 1994 hopped on its fire engine to put out Mexico. Why is Congress buying in to this Three reasons.";1;0

Toni House was a blithe spirit who spoke for the Supreme Court. Kirk O'Donnell, a rock of decency and good judgment, spoke generally for Democrats and particularly for former House speaker Tip O'Neill. They both died young last month. Toni, who succumbed to lung cancer at the age of 55, was a radiant blonde. I knew her from the days when we both worked at the Washington Star.

A photograph of her mourning as the Star's final edition rolled off the press said it all. When she went to the Supreme Court in 1982, Toni's fans wondered what kind of a fit it would be. Here was an institution more reserved than the Federal Reserve, stuffy and huffy and never explaining itself. When its members ventured out of their marble temple, they sometimes dropped speeches like hand grenades in the provinces. And there was Toni, who had been a police reporter, accustomed to trading expletives with recalcitrant desk sergeants who were trying to withhold information. But the match worked wonderfully well. Toni charmed the justices into some acknowledgment of the needs of the Fourth Estate. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once said of his place of business, We are very quiet there, but it is the quiet of a storm center. Toni was at the eye of the storm. On decision day, she presided over the distribution of the latest edict from the bench. It was always a mad moment, and Toni loved it. At her memorial service at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Lyle Denniston, a famously crusty Supreme Court reporter who now works for the Baltimore Sun, told about it through tears Toni was quite at home amid that chaos indeed . . . she was quite capable of adding to the chaos, but then also uniquely gifted at bringing everything back to order. All who spoke at her service conveyed Toni's greatest quality an obligation to be delightful. She took pride in her job, but she was also a fashion plate, a gourmet cook and an impassioned gardener.

But the crisis has actually helped Virginia thus far, says Pearson in a new report by the college's Bureau of Business Research.

The dollar's strength -- until recently -- also created bargain prices on Asian-made goods. Lower import prices contributed to lower inflation in this country, Pearson noted, making U.S. workers' paychecks go further.

After months of low unemployment and intense competition for workers, U.S. companies in a variety of industries have started a round of year-end job cuts. Nearly a dozen big firms have announced staff reductions in the past week in an attempt to bolster profits amid weakening sales and pricing. Wall Street felt the jolt on Tuesday, when Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, said it would cut 3,400 jobs, or 5 of its work force. The move had Wall Street employees bracing for cuts at other securities firms. Indeed, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. yesterday laid off 100 traders, salespeople and research analysts in its bond department, people familiar with the firm said. Analysts expect the BT Alex. Brown unit of Bankers Trust Corp., which has significant exposure to Asian markets, to eliminate as much as 10 of its staff of 18,000.

Nonetheless, he still needed several thousand dollars to cover his closing costs, even though he wasn't sure exactly how much. What Rollins, 35, a facilities manager for a nonprofit group in the District, did know was where to turn for the cash a retirement fund he had set up with a previous employer. I got close to 10,000 because I couldn't get a hard figure on my closing costs, he said. But when he ended up only needing 2,600 to settle the loan, he decided to use the rest of the money to help pay the cost of expanding the house, a former photographer's studio, to 1,700 square feet of living space. Rollins is one of a growing number of consumers in the Washington area and across the country who are using a portion of their retirement nest eggs toward the purchase of a house. Whether taken as a loan or pledged as collateral in a mortgage application, such funds have become an attractive source of money for down payments, settlements, moving and decorating costs, and paying commissions to real estate agents, lenders and financial planners said.

"830982936";"1998-10-19";"The 1.3 percent raise that federal and military retirees will get in January will be the lowest cost-of-living adjustment they've received since 1986, when they also got a 1.3 percent COLA. The increase is official and will first show up in checks received in January. People getting Social Security benefits -- and that includes many federal retirees, too -- will also get the 1.3 percent raise. It reflects the rise in living costs, as measured by the consumer price index between the third quarter of this year July, August and September and the third quarter of 1997. In other words, inflation for that 12-month period rose only 1.3 percent. While many retirees are disappointed with a COLA of only 1.3 percent, most experts say it is a good thing because it means inflation is low and prices are stable. Retirees longing for the good old days of double-digit COLAs forget what double-digit inflation can do to prices on everything from food to cars. In 1979, retirees got a 10.8 percent COLA. In 1980, the COLA was 13.7 percent. And in 1981 the last time retirees got two raises in one year, they got 13.1 percent. That was a period of double-digit inflation. It also was before Congress voted to eliminate the twice-a-year COLAs that some feared would eventually push the cost of civil service retirement higher than payroll costs. Since that time, federal retirees have had to fight regularly and usually with success to get one full COLA a year. There was no COLA adjustment in 1985, and Congress and the White House delayed COLAs for three months paying them in April instead of January in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Workers who retire under the old Civil Service Retirement System get a full COLA each year. Workers who retire under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System are under a diet COLA system. They get a full COLA on the CSRS portion of their annuity. But the FERS portion of their annuity is subject to different rules. For example, if living costs as measured by the CPI are up 2 percent or less, both groups get the same increase. But if the rise in living costs is between 2 and 3 percent, CSRS benefits go up by the full amount, while payments on the FERS portion rise by only 2 percent. If the CPI goes up 3 percent or more, FERS benefits equal the CPI minus 1 percent.";0;1

The Commerce Department reported that the trade gap ballooned to 16.77 billion from a seasonally adjusted 14.55 billion in July. The August total was the largest since the department began keeping the numbers in the current format in 1992, and a department analyst estimated that it was probably the biggest since December 1985. Exports in August slipped to an adjusted 74.84 billion from 75.10 billion in July it was the lowest figure since the 73.43 billion in shipments in January 1997. Meanwhile, a growing number of countries continue to ship goods here to try to sell their way out of recession.

"842613746";"1998-10-29";"It seems that postcommunist Russia poses a greater threat to global capitalism than the Soviet Union ever did. The Russian debt default in mid-August has generated financial shock waves that could drive next year's growth rate of the world economy to the lowest level in the postwar era. There are worrying signs that the U.S. will experience a credit crunch in the banking sector that could offset the benefits of lower interest rates. And while the European economy still enjoys moderate growth momentum, it will be highly vulnerable to an export slump if the rest of the world continues to slow. The magnitude of the correction after the Russian default illustrates how profoundly global financial markets have changed as new technology has driven down the cost of trading, hedge funds have gained access to leverage from bankers, and investors have developed an increasing appetite for risk following the long Wall Street boom. In turn, these changes have exposed how vulnerable the global financial system is, and underscored the need for an international lender of last resort. One vulnerability is the remarkable interdependence that has developed among markets because of the growth of global capital flows and the increasing role of highly leveraged investors in allocating capital. In the late 1980s, capital flows to developing countries were less than 50 billion. The Cold War's end and the growth of financial markets in developing countries drove this figure up to more than 300 billion in 1996. There has also been a dramatic expansion in the size of security markets. In the U.S., the ratio of stock-market capitalization to gross domestic product has nearly tripled during the 1990s while the mutual-fund industry now has greater assets than the banking system. The spectacular performance of the U.S. equity market stimulated an appetite for risk among high-income investors that encouraged a proliferation of new hedge funds. According to survey data, the U.S. now has more than 1,200 hedge funds with 200 billion to 300 billion in assets. During the 1990s these funds have become leading players in emerging markets. When Russia defaulted, it did not merely force some hedge funds to liquidate securities in other emerging markets. Instead, it produced such losses that many bankers felt compelled to curtail both their security market and their lending exposure in emerging markets. It also prompted some hedge funds to repay the low-cost yen loans they had taken out to finance security purchases and thus encouraged a large rally in the yen. Before August, few investors would have expected a Russian default to shatter Latin America's access to credit or produce a surge in the value of the yen, but such are the consequences of today's new global financial integration.";1;0

In July, consumer confidence reached a 29-year high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at an all-time high, unemployment rates plumbed 28-year lows, and the dollar grew stronger against virtually every currency on earth. By late August consumer confidence was down, as was the dollar, and a growing number of economists were forecasting recession in 1999. Yet no sooner had the doomsayers spoken then the Dow rebounded and the economic outlook brightened once again. Volatile markets will always be with us. But what's of real concern is the increasingly volatile and self-contradictory nature of our economic policies. The Federal Reserve, shifting abruptly from the inflation front to the recession front, has cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point and revved up monetary growth rates beyond nearly all targeted growth ranges. Yet undermining this new tack are constrictive fiscal policies -- higher taxes and burgeoning regulations -- which virtually guarantee that output cannot keep pace with the money supply. If previous business cycles are any guide, the result will almost certainly be a return of inflation and the end of the steady-growth economy. Fiscal and regulatory policies today are particularly burdensome. Taxes consume 42 of personal income, and regulations cost 10 of gross domestic product. The federal tax code has grown from 11,400 words when it was conceived in 1913 to 555 million words today. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, which like so many of its predecessors was billed as a tax-code simplifier, actually created 824 amendments and added 285 new sections to the existing code. It requires an estimated 60 million hours of extra work by taxpayers, creates 18 new tax forms and revises 230 existing forms. As Mark Twain said, History may not repeat itself, but it sure rhymes. What measures might be taken to synchronize fiscal and monetary policies into a pro-growth, price-stabilizing mode Years ago, Milton Friedman recommended putting the Fed on automatic pilot, meaning that it should create money at a steady rate of 3 to 5, consistent with the estimated long-term growth potential of real output. In revisiting this guide, it is especially helpful to recall that in its 84-year history the Fed has tended to be reactive rather than pre-emptive. Its sudden midcourse corrections have merely amplified the swings of the business cycle.";1;0

"842616929";"1998-11-17";"After several years of relatively flat health-insurance costs, U.S. businesses are starting to be hit with a startling increase in premiums -- and small businesses are being whacked the hardest. Premium increases in health-policy renewal notices for 1999 are running as high as 50 for some small companies, according to benefits consultants. Even medium and large companies are seeing rises of about 5, after flat or even declining health costs in the past few years.

For large companies, the rise in premiums isn't nearly as painful. According to health-care consultants, the most aggressively managed health plans at large companies are seeing annual increases of between 4 and 5, after flat increases last year. But overall, says Edwin Hustead, senior vice president of Hay Group, a benefits consulting firm, insurers probably are going to be asking for rate increases of 6 to 7 or as much as around 10 for 1999. And a recent survey of Fortune 500 benefits managers by BT Alex. Brown found that they expect an average 10.3 increase in premiums for health-maintenance-organization coverage. That compares with an average increase of 5.9 for 1998. Small companies have always been hit harder than large companies by healthcare inflation, largely because their tiny employment bases pose much greater actuarial risks to insurers. In large companies, the costs of sudden medical events is spread over hundreds or thousands of workers. But in a small company, if just a few employees bear children at the same time, for example, the increased cost to the insurer for medical and hospital expenses, in percentage terms, could be enormous, and insurers try to recover those costs through large premium increases.";1;0

The city and state are putting up a record 560 million in subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits to build a 60-story office tower, including a state-of-the-art trading facility, across from the Big Board's current home at Broad and Wall streets. The long-expected agreement is critical to both city and exchange. The stock exchange gets vital space to add more foreign stocks and trading technology, while the city and state retain the institution that defines the New York City financial district, which has only recently recovered from the early 1990s real-estate recession. But the deal also carries risks for both sides. The Big Board, by far the world's biggest stock market, is prospering now, but its open outcry system of trading stocks on a physical floor faces serious challenges from electronic-trading systems. Such systems have prompted many foreign markets to scrap their floors entirely. And though it is the financial district's first new office tower in 10 years, signs of a slowing economy have made speculative new construction risky, and some projects are already being called off around the country. The agreement, announced jointly yesterday by the state, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Big Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Grasso, is subject to a more definitive agreement and to approval by the exchange's board. Under the deal, the city and state will acquire a site across Broad Street now primarily occupied by J.P. Morgan & Co. and find a developer to build the tower.";1;0

Today, for example, the PE ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the best proxy for the broad market, is an astronomical 32, compared with an average of 19 over the past 12 years.

With a colleague, economist Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, I have been working for the past year on a book that offers an explanation for the fabulous returns of recent years. We argue that stocks are moving now to correct a state of perennial undervaluation and that this strong upward trend will continue. Our analysis is pretty technical, but it begins with a fact that economists have known for years Over the long term, stocks are no more risky than bonds. Stocks and bonds should logically provide roughly the same returns, but stocks return far more -- an average of 11 percent a year, compared with just 5 percent for bonds.";0;1

Well, the men who have led California may not always have echoed the inspiring majesty of the Sierras or the rugged power of the Tehachapis. But like it or not, the governors of modern California have been almost perfectly matched to their times. The thoughtful Pat Brown, elected in 1958, earnestly believed in an expansive future, devoting himself to the transportation and education systems that would undergird the California economy. When things seemed to be moving too fast and too far, voters in 1966 replaced Mr. Brown with Ronald Reagan, who promised a return to the homespun values he made famous in his black-and-white movies. His successor in 1974, Jerry Brown, seemed to embody the ambiguity of the '70s, simultaneously preaching lowered expectations and iconoclastic -- some thought reckless -- innovation. Straight-arrow George Deukmejian saw California through the conformist 1980s, while ex-Marine Pete Wilson marched the state past recession and retrenchment in the early '90s. So what does the landslide election of Gray Davis -- by any account, California's big winner of 1998 -- tell us about our own time After all, Mr. Davis seems best defined by what he lacks in comparison to his predecessors -- that is, the vision of the elder Mr. Brown, the charisma of Mr. Reagan, the audacity of Mr. Brown Jr., the certitude of Mr. Deukmejian, the pugnacity of Mr. Wilson. But for all the talk of how apt Mr. Davis's first name is, the new governor does seem to personify the cautious optimism with which California looks to the next millennium. Great calamities have befallen the state in the not-so-distant past, but the resolute way Californians rebuilt after earthquake and riot and recession proved that fundamental strengths remained to be -- and, indeed, should be -- tapped. To the steady Mr. Davis falls the task of harnessing those strengths -- without exhausting them. Of course, for every winner, there is a loser. For this year, on the flip side of Mr. Davis's victory was the California Republican Party, which lost not only the governor's office, but also the statewide posts of attorney general and treasurer, seats in both houses of the Legislature and the campaign against Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. This doubtless leaves the state GOP feeling confused and out-of-touch -- as the Democrats once did.";1;0

Yesterday, the Nasdaq Stock Market, which provides the price listings used by newspapers for more than 10,000 mutual funds, sent a memo to U.S. mutual-fund companies asking them to make any necessary changes to their year-end prices. The move came after a number of fund companies, including giant Fidelity Investments, experienced problems publishing accurate share prices for funds that held the stock of America Online Inc., which experienced year-end price swings on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, the last trading day of 1998. The swings caused confusion among mutual funds over the closing price for AOL that day. The problems affected several wellknown funds, including Fidelity's Magellan Fund. In pricing shares of funds that held stock of the Internet company, several fund outfits initially used an incorrect, lower closing price for AOL when distributing per-share fund data to outlets for publication in newspapers and other uses. As a result, the price that mutual-fund buyers were charged to purchase funds that held AOL stock was actually higher than the too-low price that appeared in their newspaper fund listings. In a memo to fund companies, Nasdaq called on fund groups that may have a problem to correct the closing net-asset value of funds for 1998.

Two companies, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp., are warning that their fourth-quarter earnings will drop below year-earlier levels. Boeing Co., which has struggled all year, is expected to do better in the quarter than it did in the year-earlier quarter but is warning of problems this year. Only Raytheon Co.'s prospects look brighter. Boeing and Northrop Grumman, whose fortunes are partially tied to the Seattle plane builder, have both warned of 1999 profit shortfalls of as much as 25 and 20, respectively, below Wall Street expectations, because of Boeing's miscalculation of the Asian economic crisis. The region's collapsing demand for jetliners -- especially the 747-led Boeing to announce sharp production cutbacks that will pressure margins in its commercial-jetliner division, which accounts for 60 of revenue. For the quarter, however, analysts estimate that Boeing earned about 42 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of 51 cents a share a year earlier, when the company struggled not with Asian fallout but with a costly production bottleneck at its Seattle-area assembly lines. Also in the year-earlier quarter, Boeing posted a one-time 1.4 billion pretax charge to phase out two jetliner models it inherited in its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp. Northrop Grumman, which derives about 12 of its revenue from building jetliner parts, most notably for the 747 jumbo jet, last week posted a 105 million charge stemming from increased costs to complete the fuselages because of Boeing's cutbacks. Additionally, Northrop Grumman, Los Angeles, posted a 20 million charge related to delays in a separate defense-electronics program. As a result, the company likely earned 90 cents a diluted share, compared with 1.71 a share in the year-earlier quarter, analysts say. Northrop Grumman's smaller charge, for the test delay, was typical of problems among the largest defense contractors.

We must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth, the president said during his State of the Union address last night. The plan, offered in the face of a congressional effort to remove the president from office, drew immediate and harsh criticism from congressional Republicans. But by agreeing to channel Social Security funds into the stock market and advocating individual savings accounts, the president advanced a debate that promises to be one of the most provocative of 1999. For Wall Street, the stakes are huge. The Clinton plan and some congressional alternatives would channel between 650 billion and 1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars into stocks over the next 15 years. At the end of that time, White House officials said, the government would own 4 of the entire U.S. market. A number of Republican alternatives would channel as much money into the stock market, but would do it through individual accounts. The amounts being talked about are large but not overwhelming. An investment of 650 billion over 15 years would equal about 3.6 billion in new money a month. By comparison, individual investors have put 1.1 trillion into the stock market since 1991 through mutual funds, or about 11.5 billion a month, according to the Investment Company Institute.

But some experts caution that such a huge shift could further pump up stock prices that some already consider inflated, while possibly hurting the bond market. Clinton is proposing diverting 62 percent of an anticipated 4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years to Social Security, then investing less than one-quarter of that amount in the equity markets instead of Treasury securities, in which the fund now invests.

Residential building permits issued by the county rose 23 percent last year, to 8,342, from 6,774 in 1997, according to figures released this week. The level of activity was the highest since the mid-1980's, when a housing boom added 11,000 to 13,000 new homes a year.

The hero to whom economists will build statues to commemorate this epoch is the American consumer. Yankee Consumer shoulders the burden of a world suddenly adrift economically by continuing to borrow, spend and consume with impressive single-mindedness. If that spending suddenly stops, the international financial game of musical chairs played in the Clinton years will come to a devastating halt. But there's also evidence that American consumers have instinctively understood that the world economy now operates on a new and still poorly glimpsed paradigm that pays little attention to classic rules of inflation, productivity or the relationship between currency values and interest rates.

A day after Clinton made an overhaul of Social Security the centerpiece of his State of the Union address, his plan raised fundamental questions about whether the federal government should assume an unprecedented role in the workings of private enterprise. Greenspan, reflecting a wave of criticism that surfaced yesterday, contended that by pouring billions of dollars in Social Security reserves into Wall Street for the first time, the government inevitably would mingle politics into its investment decisions and would not produce the kind of returns that the administration hopes for. He also raised concerns about whether the government would end up in the business of picking which American companies are worth investing in. There is really no strong evidence to suggest any positive aspects of moving Social Security funds into equities, Greenspan, the chief architect of the government's last major revisions to Social Security 16 years ago, told members of the House Ways and Means Committee.

"842614124";"1999-01-22";"The most arresting part of President Clinton's State of the Union message was his proposal to shore up the Social Security system. The president is correct in focusing on this challenge. In 1950 there were 16 taxpaying workers for every retired person in the U.S. Today there are just over three workers per retiree, and the ratio is expected to fall below two during the next century. If Social Security benefits are to be maintained under present arrangements, substantial tax increases will be required on workers and companies -- a burden that will discourage employment. Alternatively, other government receipts will be required or large government deficits will reappear. Small wonder that Mr. Clinton has searched for a magic bullet that might painlessly avoid the hard choices. There are two parts to the president's proposal. The first is to preserve the budget surplus and allocate a substantial proportion to the trust fund. The second is to shore up the system by investing 700 billion from the trust fund in the stock market over the next 15 years. Presumably by investing in stocks that historically have produced returns considerably above the yield on long-term Treasury bonds, the trust fund would grow more rapidly, and the date when the fund would run out of money would be pushed out much later in the century. Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest part of the trust fund in equities is the more radical part of his plan. It is a bad idea with unpredictable and probably damaging consequences. Moreover, simply investing a part of the trust fund in stocks will not provide the extra resources to spare us from making hard choices during the next century. Having the government invest in private securities runs against the principles of free markets and could well interfere with the efficiency of the capital-allocation process. While the government would undoubtedly propose that the funds be given to an independent or private agency that would invest in a very broad equity index of perhaps thousands of securities, such a plan would necessarily increase the allocation of capital to larger companies at the expense of very small entrepreneurial concerns that lack the liquidity to accommodate large government purchases.

Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose to 1.415 trillion yen 12.36 billion on a customs-cleared basis in December from 1.237 trillion yen a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. The December figures reversed a narrowing of 16 in the trade surplus in November, and set the country's surplus growing again for the 20th time in the past 21 months. For all of 1998, Japan's trade surplus expanded 40 to 13.985 trillion yen, while the surplus with the U.S. grew 33 to 6.697 trillion yen, the ministry said. Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia shrank 36 last year to 3.977 trillion yen. In December, Japan's overall exports fell 12 to 4.130 trillion yen. But in a continuation of a pattern that has pushed Japan's surplus steadily higher since Asia's economic crisis hit, imports fell even faster, declining 22 to 2.715 trillion yen. On the import side, it was the steepest monthly drop in 12 years. Exports to the U.S. fell 6.1 to 1.175 trillion yen, while imports from the U.S. fell 25 to 578 billion yen, bringing Japan's surplus for the month to 597.26 billion yen. Japan's surplus could expand further if the country's weak economy continues to overwhelm the boost a strengthening yen usually gives to imports. A stronger yen tends to make imports more appealing because they cost less in yen terms. Still, in December, the drop in imports came despite an increase in the yen's value to an average of 119.91 per dollar in December from 128.18 yen per dollar the previous December.";1;0

But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs. Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment. And what a reward it is 1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7 of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal. Just for reference Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9 of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4 of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War 19 in 1952, Vietnam 19.7 in 1969 and the Cold War 19.7 of 1981. He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up. It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by 143 billion, or 9, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of 126.2 billion, or 8.7, from 1996 to 1997.";1;0

Last Friday, the government said Canada's unemployment rate fell to 7.8 in January from 8 in December, hitting its lowest level since June 1990. Employment in January rose 87,400, or 0.6, its biggest monthly rise since December 1987. The Canadian dollar finished the week at 67.08 U.S. cents, its strongest level since last July. But longer term, recent studies conclude, slowing productivity growth threatens to drag down Canada's living standard for decades to come. In different ways, the Canadian dollar's years-long slide, high taxes, skimpy research budgets and heavy regulation are all taking their toll. Signs of trouble are spreading. Here in Montreal, BioChem Pharma Inc. became a star of Canada's biotechnology sector by developing the widely used AIDS drug 3TC. But now, the company is moving aggressively to expand its vaccine business -- in Massachusetts. BioChem tried for two years to lure development specialists to Canada from the U.S., but attracted zero qualified people, says its chief executive officer, Francesco Bellini.

Since 1990, manufacturing productivity has increased less than half as fast in Canada as in the U.S., the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reports.

A mere 4 of the banks said they were tightening lending standards to small companies, compared with 15 in November. When the Fed cut interest rates last fall, it cited, among other things, banks' reluctance to make loans and investors' reluctance to buy risky corporate bonds. The new Fed survey suggests that credit conditions have improved lately, though they still aren't as easy as they were in the first half of 1998. Business demand for loans seems to have strengthened over the past three months, the new survey showed. The major factor, the bankers told the Fed, was that business customers have shifted borrowing from other sources that have become less attractive. However, the Fed noted that U.S. branches of foreign banks continue to show a reluctance to make business loans.

The surplus wiped out the District's 332 million deficit from years of overspending, leaving the city with a positive balance of 112.5 million.

Gains in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- are a key ingredient in raising the nation's living standards. Consider this arithmetic Last year businesses other than farms increased their workers' compensation 4.2 percent while raising the prices they charged only 0.7 percent. The companies could do that without clobbering their profits because productivity gains offset 2.2 percentage points of that difference. And other cost-saving actions reduced non-labor costs by 1.4 percent on each unit of output. The overall result was a combination that's hard to beat. The firms eked out a small increase in profit on each unit sold, workers' real pay went up 2.6 percent faster than consumer prices, and inflation went down. The Labor Department uses the consumer price index, which rose 1.6 percent last year, to adjust compensation for inflation.

You read that right. It may be hard to believe when every street corner seems to have a politician claiming you're overtaxed and need a tax cut. But an analysis by the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm for The Washington Post shows that Reagan-era cuts for higher-income taxpayers, Clinton-era help for the working poor and targeted tax cuts contained in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement have all helped keep federal taxes for most Americans lower than they were in 1979. To the extent that the economy has made everybody better off, they're better off and they're not paying as much tax as they would have under the old rules, said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche. This analysis might help explain why some of the oomph has gone out of the impact of tax-cut promises. Robert J. Dole's pledge to cut taxes across the board did little for his losing 1996 campaign against President Clinton. And recent polling indicates that Republican calls for another tax cut don't seem to excite many Americans. Most seem to prefer improving education or overhauling Social Security. Republicans argue that a tax cut is necessary because, by their analysis, when federal taxes are measured against the size of the overall economy, the federal tax burden is as high as it has been in more than half a century. Federal tax revenue is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to hit 20.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product this year GDP is a common measure of the size of the economy. That would mark the second-highest level recorded since the dawn of the modern income tax in 1913. Tax revenue hit its highest level ever-- 20.9 percent of GDP--in 1944, when the federal government was extracting enormous amounts of tax revenue to finance World War II.";0;1

Excluding food and energy prices, considered to be volatile sectors, consumer prices rose a similar 0.1 in January, following a 0.3 increase in December.

The economy expanded at a 3.9 rate in 1998. Despite the economy's stronger-than-expected growth, the forecasters are more optimistic about inflation than they were in previous surveys. They expect consumer prices to rise only 2 in 1999, marking down their forecasts to reflect changes in the government's consumer price index. Over the next decade, the forecasters expect the CPI to climb 2.3 a year. With continued growth and little uptick in inflation, the forecasters expect the stock market to keep climbing over the next decade, but they foresee returns closer to the historical norm. On average, they expect the total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 index to be 8 a year after inflation, down from the 9 they forecast last year.

Although the stock market showed a mixed reaction to the Fed chief's testimony, bond prices sank. Analysts pointed to Mr. Greenspan's comment that the Fed is evaluating whether the third of last year's three quarter-percentage-point interest rate cuts remains appropriate. But most of Mr. Greenspan's testimony was a catalog of the considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook and an attempt to explain why inflation remains so docile. The upside risk is that the economy's strength will outstrip its capacity to produce, and inflation will finally emerge. After eight years of economic expansion, Mr. Greenspan said, the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions. Employers can't keep hiring as they have been, because the hiring pool is shrinking. But the downside risks are also substantial. Stock prices, which have sustained consumer and business spending, are high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued, Mr. Greenspan said.

Consumers' tastes in greeting cards are changing faster than they have in the past, an American Greetings spokesman said.

"842615772";"1999-03-08";"President Carlos Menem of Argentina recently proposed that his country give serious consideration to full dollarization -- the abandonment of its own currency, the peso, whose value is already fixed to the U.S. dollar. It's a good idea, not just for Argentina but for other countries in the Western Hemisphere. But the dollarization of the Americas won't happen without U.S. leadership. Argentina's disciplined monetary policy stands in stark contrast with that of some of its neighbors. At the beginning of the 1990s, Argentina enacted an array of economic reforms, including a currency-board type of monetary system. This regime ensured a fixed exchange rate -- one peso to the dollar -- and thereby promoted stability in prices and interest rates. Other Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, instituted some economic reforms but failed to make basic changes in monetary institutions. These countries adopted the worst-of-all-worlds system in which exchange rates neither float nor are genuinely fixed. Hence, they have suffered from volatility in exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. On some occasions, such as the Mexican debt crisis and devaluation of 1994-95 and the ongoing Brazilian fiscal crisis and devaluation, the financial markets have speculated that Argentina would deviate from its peg to the dollar. Argentina has withstood these pressures in the past, notably in 1995. But today's Brazilian situation is especially serious because Brazil is Argentina's largest trading partner. Argentina feels pressure to respond to Brazil's devaluation with a devaluation of its own. Anticipation of a devaluation raises interest rates, because of increases in currency risk and in related default risk. Consequently, the economy tends to contract. It was to counter this speculation and to reaffirm the commitment to a fixed exchange rate that Mr. Menem floated the idea of full dollarization. Since much of Argentina's financial system already operates in terms of the dollar, the main change would be a switch of the hand-to-hand currency from pesos to dollars. Then, as in Panama, it would be virtually impossible for the government to devalue -- in effect, there would be no peso assets whose value could be reset in terms of the dollar. Thus the financial markets would have no currency risk on which to speculate. In Argentina, the currency board has become highly popular, and a further move toward dollarization might also be popular. Nevertheless, a proposal to dollarize involves political peril. For one thing, Argentina's presidential election this fall makes it difficult for the opposing political parties to agree on a major change in the monetary regime. Domingo Cavallo, the principal architect of the Argentine economic miracle, opposes a move soon toward dollarization.";1;0

In part, the report simply confirms what previous research has showed Florida generally enjoys lower costs -- particularly labor costs -- than most of its rival states. For many sectors, that helps translate into strong competitiveness. For example, Florida's electronics-manufacturing sector is highly profitable, thanks in large part to low labor costs, the report notes. But with Florida's relatively low-skill, low-wage work force, productivity tends to be low, the report concludes. That is contributing substantially to relatively weak profitability in some industries. Even Florida's mighty hotel industry suffers from profitability that's 1.5 below the national average, the report shows.

Private grade schools and preschools are boosting tuition as much as 7. Public universities, which depend on state legislation to determine tuition, won't release new fees until the summer. However, previous increases have tended to be slightly lower than private-school increases, but still above inflation. To hear some schools tell it, students should be happy that the increases aren't higher. The actual cost of a Harvard education is close to 48,000 per year, lamented Harvard University when it announced a few weeks ago that next fall's fees will rise 3.3 to 32,164.

The bank's board is expected on Tuesday to approve the new policy, which could last as long as two years. The partial guarantees, limited initially to a total of 2 billion, are intended to restore investor confidence in governments that adhere to sound economic policies but whose ability to borrow on international capital markets has been undermined by investor panic. That situation has been a common one during the financial upheaval of the past 20 months. The guarantee program, which could also apply to commercial-bank loans, is one component of a broader international effort to prevent and resolve financial crises. The bank, the International Monetary Fund and the rich countries that fund them are trying to make as much progress as possible on those initiatives in time for the World BankIMF spring meetings, here at the end of the month. A centerpiece of that effort is the search for ways to encourage private investors -- an increasing source of financing for developing countries during the 1990s -- to return to emerging-market bonds and to stay when things get shaky. The World Bank and IMF are walking a fine line. They don't want to bail out private investors who already receive high yields on emerging-market bonds because the investors are taking big risks. But the institutions also want to be sure that deserving emerging-market governments have access to private capital even when markets are nervous.

The greater the number of people without medical insurance, the less the politicians want to talk about it -- let alone deal with it. In 1992, when the plight of the uninsured became a major issue in the presidential campaign, there were 38 million non-covered Americans below Medicare age. Five years later, according to a report released last week, the number had grown by 5 million. And the rate of increase is accelerating, from an average of half a million annually in the first two years to an average of 1.2 million annually in the three most recent years. But last week, when the National Coalition on Health Care, a bipartisan group headed by former presidents Bush, Carter and Ford, put out its latest report on The Erosion of Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, it barely made a ripple. Monica Lewinsky's appearance on Saturday Night Live drew more coverage than the fact that in the most recent year cited by the report, 1.7 million Americans were added to the ranks of the uninsured. Why is this happening The report's authors, Steven Findlay and Joel Miller -- who had the assistance of Tulane University's Kenneth Thorpe, probably the country's leading authority on this question -- say the legions of the uninsured are rising because of fundamental economic and demographic forces, which, by themselves, are certain to make the problem worse. The authors say that even if the rosy economic conditions prevalent since 1992 prevail for another decade, a projected 52 million to 54 million non-elderly Americans -- one in five -- will be uninsured in 2009. If a recession occurs, that number likely will jump to 61 million -- one in four. Most of the uninsured have jobs, but increasingly, they work in small businesses or in service sectors that either do not cover employees or require them to pay so much for health insurance that they cannot afford it.

Despite weakened currencies in just about every major Latin American economy in the past five years, Argentina has hung on doggedly to its link to the dollar. The so-called Convertibility Plan, in which the dollar peg plays a key part, extinguished Argentine inflation and provided a base of stability that allowed the economy to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8 between 1991 and 1998. But because the dollar peg means Argentina can't weaken its currency to make its exports more competitive, it has to find ways to lower the cost of production. Economists say the government hasn't complemented the currency system with policies that lower costs for businesses, and that may be delaying economic recovery. If the government is going to say that convertibility is a sacred cow, they have to build competitiveness, says Pedro Lacoste, whose Buenos Aires economic-research firm bears his name. It's a tough agenda with powerful interests against it. But whoever the next finance minister is, he better be very convinced about these issues. In the early 1990s, Argentina increased competitiveness, Mr. Lacoste says, by slashing export taxes and liberalizing port regulations. But the government's attention now seems to be diverted by political shadow plays in a presidential election year. Some new tax policies appear to be working against competitiveness. In an announcement of default yesterday, power generator Central Termica Guemes SA said it wouldn't make a 3.6 million interest payment in part because of new taxes levied by the Argentine government on assets and on cash interest payments. Mr. Lacoste estimates that gross domestic product will fall 3 this year, while exports decline around 12. Yesterday, the government said auto production fell 51 in April from the same month a year earlier electricity consumption fell 9 in the same period.

I have great worries, said Gonzalez, whose cart occupies a busy street corner here. I have lost my sense of security. I have never known Panama without the Americans being here. Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate. Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero. In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent. Some polls have even found that a majority of Panamanians would like the United States to retain control of the 50-mile-long canal, or, at least, operate it in partnership with Panama similar to the current arrangement.";0;1

Overextended consumers, they pointed out, would be forced to use an ever-growing share of household income to pay credit-card bills, leaving little to support consumer spending. And if consumer spending slowed, they bemoaned, so would the economy. Yet in recent months, the statistics on the consumer debt front have shown signs of improvement. The pace of new debt has slowed significantly, delinquencies and charge-off rates are falling sharply and the amount of revolving credit outstanding declined in the first quarter.

Why a one-year Because, unlike many other housing economists, Smith thinks fixed-rate mortgage rates will go down this year and into the next. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce next week that it will raise a key interest rate -- the benchmark federal funds rate -- to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. And when the Fed plays around with interest rates, the conversation around Washington dinner party tables inevitably turns to mortgages. But nobody needs to worry, Smith said. Contrary to what many Wall Street analysts are predicting, Smith believes that mortgage interest rates, still quite low by historical standards despite their upward drift in recent months, will go down later this year. Rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage should be down around 6 percent by the end of this year, plus or minus a bit, he said. The Mortgage Bankers Association sees a downward trend as well, although not as significant a dip as Smith predicts.";0;1

The probable result of all this activity a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point. Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation. After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation Will tomorrow be the start of another long march, a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them -- Why has inflation continued to decelerate Is it due to a string of one-time favorable shocks, such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices Has that string run out";1;0

Coca-Cola, a perennially popular stock, rose 33 from January to July and then lost nearly its entire gain in the second half of the year. The company's 1.4 gain for the year, including reinvested dividends, helped depress the overall return for many a stock picker. Unless you were Timothy Swanson, a 32-year-old analyst for A.G.

And in August, when many investors were bailing out of the stock of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the company's largest bottler, Mr. Swanson saw it as a cheap buy, riding that stock for 36 before jumping off. As a result, the three-time All-Star's 36 estimated overall return easily trumped the 11 median return for the 14 analysts evaluated in the survey. To a great extent, Mr. Swanson's calls were based on macroeconomic trends.

According to the report, while most participants did start new careers after finishing their schooling, many landed jobs paying less than what they earned before they were laid off.

Married couples who are heterosexual or other workers with a familial relationship are not allowed to enter into this supervisor-employee relationship. It doesn't seem fair that it is permitted with this relationship. A There is widespread consensus that romantic relationships between bosses and subordinates aren't good business practice because, as in this case, they can stir allegations of favoritism, hurt morale and productivity, and even lead to sexual harassment lawsuits if they later go awry. An American Management Association survey in 1994 found that three-quarters of corporate personnel officials said they disapproved of relationships between higher- ranking and lower-ranking employees. But because companies are cautious about treading into the area of personal relationships, only about 6 percent of the firms had policies banning them.

For some Fed watchers, the jump in nonfarm jobs was the most troubling aspect of the report. Most economists had predicted gains in the range of 200,000 to 230,000 new jobs, well below the actual figure. Financial markets flinched at the news. After rising slightly in early morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day at 10714.03, down 79.79.

Financial futures traders, however, substantially increased their bets that the Fed would raise rates.

The brighter prospects for global growth are moving financial markets. The dollar has fallen against the yen as well as the euro, as investors shift their capital to increasingly attractive investment opportunities outside the U.S. Yesterday, the dollar dropped to its lowest level against the yen in seven months, in part because of a fresh batch of positive economic news out of Tokyo.

But he also suggested that the currency's recent softness is a price worth paying for the benefits of more-balanced world growth. A stronger global economy provides a stronger market for our exports, and reduces pressures on other countries to dump surplus products into our markets, says Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. More broadly, Mr. Summers says that recovery abroad means a more stable and harmonious global economy, in which disruptive shocks to financial systems are less likely.

"830984321";"1999-09-05";"If you hold mutual funds that are allowed to invest in all kinds of stocks, what Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve decide to do this year and beyond should make little difference to your investment decisions. As a holder of a broad-based fund, you are doing more than just buying a bunch of companies You also are investing in the brains of your fund manager. Part of the service you should expect is that your manager is able to anticipate changes in interest rates, or else to react to changes very quickly. But if you invest in individual stocks or sector-based mutual funds, interest rates matter greatly, the same way they do to the manager of a growth or general-performance fund. A good manager would dump certain stocks and embrace others if assumptions about future inflation changed. All stocks do not react the same way to higher interest rates, and no major market features more differentiated behavior among stocks than the United States. If interest rates are set to keep rising, it pays to have a plan of action. To see why rates matter so much to certain kinds of companies, imagine your household has little or no debt at all. You pay rent on an apartment every month, pay off your credit card in full regularly and take the bus to work. You are saving for some day in the future when you will buy a car or a house, maybe five or eight years down the road. How do interest rates affect you Probably only inasmuch as higher rates get you a higher return on your savings account. But if you had a mortgage and car payments tied to movable interest rates, then a major increase in rates would actually hurt you, maybe quite badly, as your mortgage payments increased. The same goes for companies. Higher interest rates can kill businesses that are heavily leveraged have a lot of debt, or those that invest heavily in bonds. Insurance companies hold piles of bonds, for instance, because they have so much premium money to invest. Because bond prices move in the opposite direction to rates, higher rates make the insurance company's bonds worth less.";0;1

More than 64 percent of the adult population is working today -- more than ever before in our history. Inflation remains at an insignificant level. Real wages have increased nearly 5 percent in just the past two years. Home ownership is at an all-time high.

According to the latest data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, even three of the four slowest-appreciating markets--Nevada, Pennsylvania and Idaho, with gains in resale value of 3 percent or less--are beating inflation in the overall economy. Hawaii posted a scant 0.1 percent appreciation rate during the last 12 months. Massachusetts continues to lead the nation's resale-value boom, with a 9.3 percent average rate of gain per house in the last year, and nearly a 30 percent increase over the last five years. That's especially impressive given Massachusetts' already high-cost housing stock. If you bought a 300,000 house outside Boston last year, it's probably worth about 327,000 today. If you bought it in 1994, it's probably worth about 386,000. Other relatively pricey home real estate areas are not far behind.";0;1

Perhaps the most shocking conclusion of the report so far is that the cost of linking Boston's primary train stations has actually gone down since the first study of the project was completed in 1993. The study has the project's price tag at 3.68 billion, which, after adjusting for inflation, is 35 less than the 1993 figure.

The idea that groups and individuals can inject unlimited, unregulated amounts of money allegedly for party building into campaigns for federal office has made a mockery of the post-Watergate reforms enacted in 1974. The fatal flaw of the 1974 law is the capping of individual contributions at 1,000 per person--never adjusted or indexed for inflation. This has made Senate and House incumbents very difficult to beat, and has meant that non-incumbent candidates not personally wealthy or closely connected to the party establishment are finding it increasingly difficult to mount serious campaigns. I believe soft money, whether by corporations, unions, interest groups or individuals, should be prohibited. But to make such a ban work, reformers must accept the simple fact that if we want competitive elections, the ability of candidates to raise large amounts of money from individuals and from fully regulated political action committees is a good thing, not a bad thing. The limit on individual contributions should be raised to 5,000 and indexed against future inflation. The limit on contributions by political action committees should be raised from 5,000 to 10,000 and indexed. I do not favor putting restrictions on issue ads. The American people should have the right to express their opinions under the First Amendment. But encouraging people and groups who care about issues to advance their beliefs by supporting candidates they agree with will go nowhere until campaign contributions can once again be large enough to make a difference in our elections.

I want to be the good steward of a good economy in which working Americans of all incomes can become financially secure.

A process in which everyone's voice can be heard, where dissent is respected and candidates run on the strength of their ideas--not the weight of their wallets.

"842614046";"1999-10-14";"Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica, an Italian economics journal. Reprinted with permission. Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset. The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25 under Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon. But in June 1932, during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a maximum level of 60. They remained at or frequently considerably above this level for half a century. The grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to placate the political right. The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second pillar in the platform of supply-side economics. Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented models of global monetarism and macroeconomics.";1;0

But sales of new and existing homes are still running close to record levels, and auto sales are on track to set a record of more than 17 million this year.

"842617458";"1999-10-18";"WASHINGTON -- Though a sharp jump in wholesale prices in September set off fears on Wall Street that long-dormant inflation has awakened, economists said the numbers were artificially boosted by a number of one-time factors, and that widespread evidence of rising prices was still slight. Indeed, the report seems unlikely to spark much panic in one place it matters most, the Federal Reserve, which is charged with keeping inflation in check. In comments over the past few weeks, top officials have been more likely to marvel about the tameness of prices than to express concern about nascent inflation. The sticker shock . . . exaggerates the inflation numbers, economists at Warburg Dillon Reed LLC wrote Friday in a report to clients, adding that the price rises do not represent a significant change in the underlying trend of inflation. The Fed, too, will be able to look past these developments, the Warburg analysts concluded. While the odds of a central-bank interest-rate increase next month may be rising, they said, they are not yet above 50 in our opinion. The numbers in the Labor Department's producer-price report for September were, indeed, stunning. The index for finished goods soared by 1.1, seasonally adjusted, the biggest monthly increase in nine years. That followed a large 0.5 jump in August, an especially terrible back-to-back performance for a price gauge that has been flat or negative for much of the past two years.

But your body is one thing, your net worth something else. And with the market off 5.92 last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now they're worried it's too late, that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall. It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S. economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year. Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk of a downturn during the election campaign If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S. economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, I plan to stay within the spending caps. That's a Beltway thing it's not an economic strategy. A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant prices have been blipping upward. The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices.

Argentina's finance minister is second in importance to the president. The country doesn't have enough savings to finance its own growth or debt load, so the finance minister must constantly bolster the confidence of international investors. One of the first challenges faced by the new economic team will be the financing of about 16 billion in Argentine debt in global markets next year. The second challenge is to regain momentum on economic reforms. The Argentine peso is fixed to the U.S. dollar, and without additional policies that enhance productivity or lower costs, Argentine companies risk losing competitiveness.

Analysts said bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, were hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising inflation. That warning sounded familiar to U.S. investors, who fear the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since October 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of the fixed returns available on bonds.";0;1

But investors, so far, aren't convinced. The big home builder last month posted its 17th consecutive quarterly earnings report that topped or matched analysts' expectations. Yet its stock sells for just seven times earnings that are expected to increase by 52 to 145 million, or 3.02 a diluted share, for the fiscal year ending next month. The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 17.8125, up 6.25 cents and near a 52week low. Industry-wide, earnings multiples are exceptionally low by historical standards, Merrill Lynch analyst Robert F. Curran says, probably among the lowest ever. The reason fears that another interest-rate increase is imminent, in a year when rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have already risen nearly a percentage point. Wall Street also frets about spot labor shortages and increasing land and construction-materials costs. Bruce Karatz, Kaufman & Broad's chief executive, finds this sentiment exasperating. The market is saying 'the end is near,' and clearly doesn't give Kaufman & Broad Homes credit for changing its business model and mitigating cyclical risk, he complains.";1;0

But a leasing lawyer Meet Jonathan Mechanic, the 47-year-old, bushy-moustached head of real estate for Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in Manhattan. He employs a publicist, socializes relentlessly, and instills drama into the dusty world of landlord and tenant law by turning every negotiation into a fight. I want a tough lease. I want to win every right that can go the client's way, he says. Though rivals deplore his tactics, the 500-an-hour lawyer has collected clients such as Conde Nast Publications, a unit of Advance Publications Inc., and Jerry Speyer, plus 1998 revenue of 10 million at his 30-lawyer group. And Fried Frank aims to represent not one but two suitors, including Brookfield Financial Properties Inc., in the forthcoming contest for the country's biggest lease 10 million square feet of offices at New York's World Trade Center. In lease negotiations, lawyers routinely complain that Mr. Mechanic wastes time and money with his 50-page documents, while challenging every detail in their much shorter ones. Then, at some point, he will always pound on the table about something that surprises me because it seems so unexceptional, says attorney Philip Rosen of Weil Gotshal & Manges, who has sat across the table from Mr. Mechanic several times. Mr. Mechanic is nevertheless a very good lawyer, he adds. And his methods win clients. Real-estate investor Andrew Davidoff of Emmes Group of Cos. first encountered Mr. Mechanic 12 years ago representing a company that wanted to lease space in a building Mr. Davidoff then owned, Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City, N.J. Last year, buying out a partner in a difficult 50 million negotiation, he made sure Mr. Mechanic was working for him. He knows when to go on a rampage to get a deal closed, Mr. Davidoff says.";1;0

The downgrades by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services sent Lockheed Martin shares down 1.50 to close at 18.5625 in New York Stock Exchange 4 p.m. trading. The stock has dropped from a 52-week high of about 56.75, as a series of management and program problems have emerged in the past year. Some of the new ratings are at the lowest possible level in the investment-grade category. The drops stem from a Lockheed Martin forecast last week indicating that year-2000 cash flow will drop to less than 500 million from about 900 million estimated in late September. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., also said its year-2000 earnings are likely to be about 1 a share, instead of the 2.15 a share forecast in late September. Lockheed Martin has faced serious production and sales problems in certain of its units making satellites, rockets and some military aircraft. Wall Street experts said the most dramatic effect of the credit-agency downgrades would be the increased interest rates applied to the 3 billion or so of commercial paper the company has used for short-term borrowing. The paper typically features a variable interest rate. Another effect could be to trigger further sales of the stock by institutional holders.

The new numbers, combined with some signs the economy may be slowing, will bolster those inside the Federal Reserve arguing against an interest-rate increase when policy makers meet Nov. 16. The anemic growth in wages, in particular, gives Fed officials more breathing room to see whether the economy is slowing on its own, or whether growth can continue at the current pace without sparking inflation.

There could be more of the same in the coming months. I think international markets will continue to outperform the U.S. stock market, but perhaps not the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, said Irene Cheng, lead manager of Scudder International Fund. Ms. Cheng's assertion stems from her belief Japan is dead serious about turning around its economy. David Lui, who manages Strong International Stock Fund, agrees. A number of secular trends in Japan bode well for a lasting economic recovery, he says. Companies in Japan are restructuring, instituting layoffs and selling unprofitable divisions, moves they hadn't undertaken before. In addition, Mr. Lui says, individual investors in Japan are tiptoeing back into the market after they got so badly burned in the early 1990s, and that's a very bullish signal. A year ago, Japan's markets were starting to dig out from a devastating financial crisis. Meanwhile, European markets were thriving, in part because of optimism over the European Union's unified economy and the then-coming euro monetary unit.

"830983652";"1999-11-09";"One of the big problems that most of us have in life is that we never get to read our own obituaries, which would be our best chance to see people saying nice things about us. But high-profile corporate chieftains who announce their departures don't have this problem. They get to hear all that nice stuff while they're still around, because retirement stories strongly resemble obits, except that the subject is still alive and kicking. As witness the gushing and slobbering over General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch last week after he mentioned on a TV show that he plans to retire in April 2001. Welch would then be 65, and he would have had a nice, round 20 years at the helm of GE. Welch, the highest-profile corporate manager in the world--not to be confused with Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates, who's a founder, not merely a manager--is one of those people who make you feel good about subscribing to the Great Man Theory of business the idea that one person can make a huge difference. No matter how much of Welch's success you ascribe to historical forces and luck--the economy was dead in the water, with interest rates at 20 percent, when he took over, and it is roaring ahead now--it's clear that a good part of what's happened at GE since Welch took over in 1981 must have a lot to do with the man and the people he picked as subordinates. GE's stock price has risen from 4.18 34 adjusted for four stock splits on March 31, 1981, the day before he took over, to 134 yesterday. That 3,100 percent increase is more than triple the 900 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during that period. GE stock has risen 20.5 percent a year, compounded, compared with 13.2 for the S&P. But even as the encomiums pile up for Welch, known as Neutron Jack in his younger days for vaporizing jobs while leaving buildings intact, it's time to play my traditional role as skunk at the garden party. Welch is clearly very, very, very good. But as effective as his leadership has been in helping GE transform itself from an old- line industrial company into a sleek, finance-oriented conglomerate, it's not yet clear how good a manager Welch is. How can I say that Because picking a worthy successor is one of the most vital elements of managing. Since we don't know who Welch's successor is or how worthy he all the leading candidates are men will prove to be, I think it's too early to call Welch a management god. This may sound like nitpicking, but please bear with me. Consider, if you will, what's happened to Coca-Cola Co. since the charismatic and wonderfully well-regarded Roberto Goizueta died in 1997. He was on the same level as Welch in the business pantheon. But Goizueta's handpicked successor, Douglas Ivester, has had nothing but trouble since taking over the Coke chairmanship. Similar fates have befallen the people who succeeded two other well-regarded, visionary corporate chieftains Charles Lazarus, who retired as Toys R Us Inc. chief executive in 1994, and Anthony O'Reilly, who retired from H.J. Heinz Co. last year. Lazarus and O'Reilly were good leaders--but not, in my humble opinion, good managers. It's a bad reflection on them that their successors all seem to have had feet of clay. Hmm. It makes you wonder whether these guys were really as good as they seemed to be when they left office. And whether they'd have had trouble if they'd stayed around. Why does this matter Because it's important to keep perspective and not get swept away by conventional wisdom. Reporting about the personalities and peccadilloes of corporate managers has in large part replaced reporting about the corporations they run--both in the media world and on Wall Street. That's partly because people are generally more interesting than companies, partly because they're easier to analyze.";0;1

PricewaterhouseCoopers executives credited technology with enabling such outsourcing, making it possible to conceive of a company that concentrates on areas where it has an advantage and leaves noncore functions to others.

At that meeting, members of the policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, took no action on rates but adopted a directive that was biased toward higher rates. That decision sparked a discussion about what has happened since the FOMC agreed at the end of last year to begin announcing such moves immediately. In the past, the adoption of a biased directive was disclosed only when the minutes of a meeting were released six to eight weeks later, so market participants usually paid relatively little attention to it. This May was the first time the FOMC adopted a bias toward raising rates and announced it right away. Financial market participants reacted to the announcement, to the dismay of many of the committee members, virtually as if rates had been increased. At the next meeting, at the end of June, the target for overnight rates was raised and the committee went back to a neutral directive-- not because another rate increase wasn't likely but because the members feared that that if they said that they were still leaning toward higher rates, the market would overreact again.

For example, a person who wants to borrow 300 on his next paycheck writes a postdated check for 379. The check casher holds the check until the borrower's next payday.

Legislation will be introduced during the next Maryland legislative session to impose state regulation on the check-cashing industry. Another bill will be introduced to prohibit payday loans. Of course, the industry claims these cash advances are not loans at all but deferred deposits. But several states, including Virginia, have won court cases that found that deferred deposits were indeed loans and that the interest charged was in excess of the interest caps mandated by those states.";0;1

Mr. Specter's fellow Republicans then added billions more for themselves. Result a pork-filled budget of 1.75 trillion, bigger than the entire economy of France. But here's some surprising news The federal government is getting smaller, at least relative to the size of the economy as a whole. This year, for the first time in more than 25 years, federal spending slipped below 20 of gross domestic product. As the chart nearby shows, this percentage has been shrinking throughout the 1990s it is projected at 19.3 next year. That's still too big, but it's down from 24 just 15 years ago. True, much of this progress is a result of post-Cold War defense cutbacks, but even domestic spending is receding relative to private-sector output. This benign fiscal state of affairs seems incomprehensible, given a Congress that has proved itself incapable of cutting nearly any federal agency budgets and a president who has stopped paying even lip service to small government. But America's miracle economy, helped along by Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp's supply-side tax policies, is outgrowing the budget. The federal budget has grown by 132 in 1982, but the GDP has increased by 176. And Americans' financial wealth has grown to 32 trillion from 7 trillion, four times as fast as federal expenditures. The trend has been quite different for most of the 20th century. Federal spending as a share of GDP rose to 24 in 1982 from 4 in 1932. Who gets credit for turning things around First, Mr. Reagan, who won the Cold War, chopped punitive tax rates roughly in half and made the case that big government was the problem, not the solution. Second, Paul Volcker and his successor, Alan Greenspan, who ended double-digit inflation and returned America to price stability. Third, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Steve Case and all the other high-tech entrepreneurs who made possible today's booming information economy. All this progress has happened without any serious effort to cut federal spending. If the next president adopts the right small-government policies, he could shrink federal spending to 15 or even 10 of GDP. To get there will require a combination of modest fiscal disciplinary measures to slow federal spending and a prosperity agenda aimed at coaxing economic growth up to 4 or 5 a year. The policy prescriptions necessary include personalized accounts for Social Security, a flat 20 alternative maximum tax with unlimited IRAs, medical savings accounts for health care, unilateral free trade, the abolition of corporate welfare and an ironclad commitment to keep the Internet tax- and regulation-free.";1;0

Although inflation-adjusted prices at the pump remain near historic lows, a 31 jump this year, to an average 1.35 a gallon in November, sounded a warning bell for the auto industry that buyers could put fresh emphasis on fuel efficiency. That isn't likely to threaten what's expected to be a record-breaking year of auto sales in the U.S. in 1999, but it could ease demand for sport-utility vehicles, which are among the least fuel-efficient vehicles. Sport-utility vehicles have nearly doubled their share of U.S. sales, to 18 this year from just under 10 in 1994, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. More important for auto makers, profits from SUVs are huge, while small cars remain loss leaders. The big question for the industry is whether gasoline prices will rise high enough -- and stay there long enough -- to spook many buyers into shifting to more fuel-efficient vehicles. In the long term, the industry could respond to such demand with a raft of technologies that it is developing, from advanced internal-combustion engines to hybrid power plants that use electric power to cut fuel consumption. In the short term, however, renewed consumer consciousness about fuel efficiency could slow sales of SUVs. James Holden, president of DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. arm, which depends for much of its profits on sales of SUVs such as the Dodge Durango, says he expects average U.S. gasoline prices to rise to about 1.50 a gallon and stay there for a couple months. If prices rise much higher than that and stay there long, they would cause some shift in consumer demand to smaller trucks, he figures. But he doesn't see gasoline prices rising to a point where consumers would trade trucks for small cars. It's not going to get people to sell the Durango and the boat they tow, he says.";1;0

The Treasury Department said that last month's revenue totaled 121.4 billion while expenditures came to 149 billion. Slipping tax collections for the month accounted for most of the difference between the November 1999 and November 1998 budget totals. For the first two months of fiscal year 2000, which began Oct. 1, the government is running a deficit of 54 billion. A budget surplus still is expected for all of 2000, however.

But the really good news for automakers and their dealers was that a solid 48 percent of those buyers chose light trucks--pickups, vans, minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Trucks generally bring in more money than cars. For example, look at Ford's third-quarter 1999 performance. According to industry analysts, Ford had an average pretax profit of 953 on each vehicle that it sold in the United States in the third quarter. The automaker broke even on cars, generally losing money on smaller models such as the compact Contour sedan, while making up the losses on sales of large and luxury cars. But Ford earned an average of 2,540 on every pickup, sport- utility vehicle, van and minivan it delivered to consumers, analysts said. At the beginning of the year, if anyone had told me that we'd be looking at this kind of number, I would not have believed them, said Jim O'Connor, president of the Ford Division of Ford Motor Co.

Late in European trading, the common currency of the 11-nation euro zone was at 1.0332, strengthening from 1.0302 the previous day.

In addition to the good prospects for euro-zone growth, Mr. Duisenberg noted generous liquidity in the market and expected upward pressures on consumer prices. Although such comments could be seen as paving the way for an eventual interest-rate rise, Mr. Duisenberg stopped well short of sounding an inflation alarm. Rather, he said consumer-price increases the ECB sees for early 2000 should not give undue cause for concern. Euro-zone government bonds rose on Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which markets took as lessening the chances of a nearterm rate rise.

Late Monday evening, Ecuador's Central Bank approved Mr. Mahuad's proposal to replace Ecuador's troubled currency, the sucre, with the U.S. dollar. The president of Ecuador's Central Bank, Pablo Better, resigned in protest. Mr. Better was the only member of the Central Bank's board to oppose the measure. As Mr. Mahuad has struggled to deal with such multiple crises as widespread bank failures, a deep recession, foreign-debt defaults, rising inflation and unemployment, he has been dogged by criticism for acting too slowly and too late. His proposal to dollarize Ecuador's economy stands out as the boldest move he has made so far as president. The risk, say critics, is that Ecuadoreans and investors have lost so much faith in the beleaguered president that even this measure may not be enough to save his presidency. Mr. Mahuad's move puts Ecuador at the center of a growing and controversial movement in the developing world toward dollarization or so-called currency boards as pressures on weak currencies push countries to link them to stronger currencies. Some economists have expressed concern over the potential dangers of developing nations sacrificing control over monetary policy to the central banks of stronger, industrialized nations, whose economies have little in common with poor countries like Ecuador. Mr. Mahuad's proposal to dollarize is meant to end the currency crisis and silence growing calls for his resignation. Last week, the president declared a state of emergency to keep protests against his government from getting out of control. Yesterday, there were announcements of a new wave of protests by leaders of Ecuador's indigenous groups who were angered by the dollarization move. It's not such a bad idea, says Michael Henry, Latin America economist at ING Baring. But Mr. Mahuad has to build some credibility and break the cycle of low expectations that has plagued his government almost from the start.

They've won but one playoff series in their franchise's 30-year history, in 1976, and aren't likely to add to that total this year. The Clippers have been good for a couple of things, neither of which professional-sports teams like to claim as distinctions. One is for ticket availability Even in the new Staples Center, which they and their NBA citymates, the Lakers, occupy jointly, the Clippers are averaging 6,000 empty seats a game, about the same number as they had at their former home at the old Sports Arena the Lakers generally sell out.

The transaction was valued at about 160 billion when announced, but the decline in AOL's stock reduced the value to a current price of 138 billion. In some respects, that was completely expected, and the one-day delay before AOL's decline -- now standing at about 18 -- was largely driven by the early euphoria over the deal. But what also took place was a massive transfer of value from AOL shareholders to Time Warner shareholders, so a decline in AOL was inevitable, points out one media investment banker. Time Warner's shares ended up 25 for the week, a very respectable showing.

The deficit in goods and services, seasonally adjusted, was 940 million more than October's revised and record 25.56 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.

In a 6-3 decision, the justices said a Missouri law that capped contributions to statewide candidates at different levels, with an inflation adjustment, didn't violate free-speech rights. The law was challenged in 1998 by a small political-action group, Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The law was upheld by a U.S. district court in Missouri but overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The decision was announced yesterday, as Iowans prepared to vote in their state's caucuses in the kickoff of the 2000 campaign season. The timing highlighted the growing public disgust with the huge amount of money needed to mount a campaign and the amount of influence -- and sometimes corruption -- that such contributions often bring. As a result, both advocates and critics of campaign-finance laws had been interested in whether the high court would use the Missouri case to redraw the landscape created by its 1976 decision, Buckley vs. Valeo. At that time, the justices ruled that the Constitution permitted limits on campaign contributions but not on campaign spending. The current limit on contributions by individuals in federal elections is 1,000, slightly below the upper limit of 1,075 in the Missouri case. Writing for the majority, Justice David Souter addressed the corruption issue, which was the prime justification for the Missouri law.

"830983776";"2000-01-26";"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly. As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process. Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy heats up.  The Fed Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued price stability and has raised interest rates as in 1994 to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.  Better Management Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons the recession foreign competition deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries hostile corporate takeovers the growth of new discounters Wal-Mart, Home Depot. Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and downsizings became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and as with Volcker's recession widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.  New Technology As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise productivity.

The program will require market makers -- who quote prices at which they trade with investors -- on the NASD's OTC Bulletin Board to execute customer limit orders before their own. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock within the customer's prescribed price limit. The Bulletin Board, unlike the NASD's Nasdaq Stock Market, isn't an electronic stock forum but rather a quotation system whose securities are traded manually by and through market makers. Rules giving priority to customer limit orders on Nasdaq have been in place since early 1997, after the stock market came under scrutiny for price fixing. The 12-month program, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is part of a continuing effort by the NASD to make more-stringent rules for the Bulletin Board, home to small and infrequently traded stocks with a reputation for being more easily manipulated than those on mainstream stock markets.";1;0
"842615453";"2000-02-02";"Holman W. Jenkins Jr. Business World, Jan. 19 posed the question, What exactly is the purpose of the federal makework project known as the public audit The answer is that an audit provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements are not materially misstated. Audits make financial information more reliable by reducing the frequency and magnitude of errors and fraud. Controversy arises over how much assurance auditors should provide at a reasonable cost. Victims of fraud argue that every fraud should have been detected. Auditors argue that providing absolute assurance against fraud would make audits prohibitively expensive. Although the SEC requires public corporations to have their financial statements audited, it is a mistake to think that audits occur only by government mandate or that audits have no economic value. In 1926, prior to any government requirements, 79 of the corporations listed on the NYSE published audited financial statements. They did so because investors and creditors demanded an auditor's assurance before entrusting the corporations with their money. Today, hundreds of not-for-profit organizations and private businesses voluntarily hire auditors. Research shows that private businesses with audited financial statements pay lower interest rates on their commercial bank loans than do similar private businesses whose financial statements are not audited. Evidently, lenders value the assurance provided by an auditor's report. Thousands of CPAs employed in small accounting firms are proud to provide audit services to their clients. Unfortunately, many in the Big 5 appear to share Mr. Jenkins's view that audits are unnecessary compliance exercises. The large firms seem ashamed of their accounting heritage and now call themselves professional service organizations. The problem is not that audits have no value. The problem is that too many large firm partners are more concerned about making money than with upholding professional standards. Paul M. Clikeman, Ph.D., CPA Assistant Professor of Accounting";1;0

"842614857";"2000-02-08";"WASHINGTON -- Even as he trumpeted his plan to pay off the national debt by 2013, President Clinton quietly suggested an increase in the legal ceiling on how much debt the government can hold. Why The answer lies in the difference between the debt held by the public and the total debt that the Treasury owes, which includes long-term obligations to other government agencies -- notably the Social Security trust fund -- for future benefits. Many economists consider the public debt, which the White House projects will decline to zero in 2013 from 3.48 trillion in the current fiscal year, to be the most important. That is what affects interest rates and the government's immediate impact on the broader economy. Mr. Clinton uses that measure when he talks of cutting up the government's credit card. But some analysts and politicians consider total government debt a better measure of the government's long-term responsibilities, and that figure rises as aging baby boomers stake an ever-bigger claim on Social Security benefits. Congressional limits on federal borrowing apply to that figure, not just publicly held debt. The current statutory debt limit is 5.95 trillion. For the current fiscal year, the debt subject to that limit will be safely below that figure -- about 5.65 trillion. But under the Clinton plan, government debt would cross the ceiling by hitting 6 trillion in 2004 and 6.79 trillion in 2013.";1;0

The problems that dominate day-to-day legislative business--e.g., reducing pollution and congestion, improving medical care, providing more police--are not resource problems The sacrifices involved in paying for such things are not prohibitive. Christopher DeMuth, head of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that although Americans are unprecedentedly prosperous, self-sufficient and at peace with one another, government continues to grow prodigiously because of little- understood dynamics. Government outlays federal, state, local and regulatory costs-- largely imposed on the private sector--have grown more than 50 percent faster than the economy for 50 years and now claim more than one-third of GDP. The federal government owns one-third of all land, pays for 40 percent of medical care, manages nearly 50 percent of individuals' retirement funds and regulates many industries. Most Americans live and work in a web of government rules. Forces working to inhibit government include globalization--the ability of capital and services to move to hospitable locales--and technological change. For a quarter-century, says DeMuth, the government has been trying and largely failing to regulate the computer industry Although it may lasso an individual firm such as Microsoft, it has no hope of corralling the entire industry as it did trucking and railroads in an earlier age. However, more private wealth means more resources for the traditional lobbying of government, and more incentives for government to try something new.

Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was unchanged at 0.2. The savings rate bounced back to 1.4 after hitting a record low of 1 in December. The numbers, which suggest Americans are thinking twice about some purchases, represent an about-face from December when personal income grew just 0.3 and consumer spending surged a revised 1.1.

The increase in personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, was boosted by pay increases for federal civilian and military personnel, agricultural subsidies, and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Excluding the special factors, such as a 1.3 rise in government wage expenditures, the largest monthly gain since January 1993, income would have advanced 0.6.

This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans. Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest. Prying their hands off the economy and moving toward liberalization will mean a long, hard fight, well beyond the simple dollar-for-sucres exchange.";1;0

"842616930";"2000-03-13";"After lying low for a couple of decades, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is back with a vengeance. The cartel has rediscovered its economic muscle and driven up oil prices to more than 30 a barrel. Democrats and Republicans alike are demanding that government bring down prices. But before we dust off the policy playbook of the Carter era, we should recall some lessons learned. First, begging OPEC heads of state to increase production -- as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is now doing -- is a waste of time. Production decisions are determined by financial considerations. Nothing will change that. Trying to convince OPEC that it's in the cartel's best interest to head off a global recession -- thus, that it should increase oil production -- is naive. OPEC members are almost entirely dependent on the oil trade. So long as oil profits remain robust, global recession need not concern them. The recessions of 1974 and 1979 demonstrated that OPEC can make a lot of money during hard times. Second, investigating big oil for price gouging is counterproductive. In the 1970s those suspicions were stoked by stories of oil tankers lingering offshore, supposedly waiting for prices to go up before they unloaded their cargo. Tankers were indeed lingering, but it was because docks were overloaded and ships had to wait to unload. Big oil -- then and now -- is guilty only of passing on its increased costs to consumers instead of selling at a loss. Political saber rattling about alleged corporate profiteering makes the crisis worse. The only hedge against supply disruptions in the near term is inventories. But inventories are costly to maintain. If companies can't cash them out at a profit during price spikes because they fear criminal investigation or the imposition of windfall-profit taxes, they won't bother maintaining inventories. Ironically, that is the upshot of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Politicians, alarmed that oil companies don't keep stockpiles, decided that the government must do so. Yet the existence of the reserve makes it certain that companies won't stockpile. Oil companies don't know if or when government might flood the market, dropping prices and preventing them from profiting from their inventories.";1;0

Duncan is scheduled to present the budget today during a noon news conference at Twinbrook Elementary School in Rockville. The size of the spending increase for education can be attributed partly to a school system plan to keep better track of spending and hold teachers more accountable. Duncan had criticized the school system for not having such a plan in place. The increase also comes as a strong economy generates windfalls for local governments, and many regional school systems are benefiting.

But the latest gauge, the Labor Department's February producer-price index, which measures prices paid to the nation's farms, factories and refineries, proved inconclusive. Inflation hawks could cite the index's larger-than-expected 1 increase, the largest monthly advance since October 1990, as evidence that a broader resurgence may be on the horizon. As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4 higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months. On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3 for the month, with a 6.3 surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1, the lowest year-over-year change since last November. Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report.

The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits, meanwhile, fell to a 27-year-low for the week ending April 1, lending further credence to the argument that the labor market may still be contracting. Still, there's another plausible interpretation. March's surge in payroll growth comes on the heels of a weaker-than-expected February increase of just 7,000 jobs, revised downwards from a previous estimate of 43,000 new positions. And while more jobs were created in March than in any month since February 1996, when 454,000 new positions were added to business payrolls, the number may be significantly overstated. The Census Bureau, for example, hired 117,000 temporary workers in March, while a statistical quirk gave the month a fiveweek survey period instead of the customary four-week period, adding about 75,000 jobs. Stripping away such factors brings the actual number of new positions down to a more moderate 224,000. Indeed, excluding all special factors, payroll growth slowed to about 190,000 per month in the first quarter of this year, compared with an average of 226,000 per month in 1999.";1;0

Last July, still trying to distinguish itself from the tire industry, the company moved its headquarters from Richfield, Ohio, near Akron, the rubber capital of the world, to Charlotte, N.C., home of Coltec Industries, an aircraft-parts maker that Goodrich bought last year for 1.6 billion in stock and cash.

With the U.S economy growing so strongly and signs of inflation beginning to emerge, the Fed is firmly on the path toward higher U.S. interest rates. That puts strong pressure on the ECB to lift European rates -- even beyond what is necessary to control European growth pressures. For some of the smaller ECB member countries, this is an ironic change of circumstances. In the years prior to the formation of the ECB, less economically advanced countries often complained of being held hostage to the monetary policy of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, over which they had no say. Germany was, and still is, the major economic power in Europe and to remain on a level playing field with Germany, other central banks had to follow the Bundesbank's lead. But with the ECB, the rest of Europe thought they would finally have a voice. Instead, they now feel they're hostage to Alan Greenspan. The euro, the shared currency of 11 nations, has lost 24 of its value against the dollar since its inception in January 1999.

But today, between the advent of such technologies as the Internet and the end of such deadweight as Soviet rule, globalization is moving with a speed and agility that just a few years ago most modern world travelers scarcely imagined. Between 1990-99, the real volume of world merchandise exports grew 72. Especially significant is that merchandise exports of developing nations grew last year by 8.5, more than twice the global average, according to the World Trade Organization. This suggests still larger trade leaps in the offing, as countries long self-exiled from world markets rearrange their institutions to become global players.

Industrial output jumped 0.9 last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1 higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3 increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly. With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4 to 82.1, the first time that the index has climbed above 82 in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecks The report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years. Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6 run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7 in April, and is up an eye-popping 59 year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6 after being flat the last two months.";1;0

That's according to the fourth edition of the American Electronics Association's Cyberstates A State-by-State Overview of the High-Technology Industry. The report, which is being released today, takes a number of different measures of the region's high-tech industry -- including its employment, wages and share of exports -- and compares them with those of other states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The report, funded in part by the Nasdaq Stock Market, also provides an analysis of both high-tech venture-capital investments and research-and-development expenditures. The association defines high-tech using three broad categories manufacturing, communications services, and software and computer-related services. This definition doesn't include such fields as biotechnology or aerospace. High-tech employees in Washington state were the best paid around as of 1998, earning an average annual salary of 105,681 -- almost twice the U.S. average of 57,701. And it's more than three times the state's average private-sector wage of 32,914. Dick Conway, a Seattle economist who tracks regional business issues, attributes that to the high stock-option income at Microsoft Corp. Puerto Rico had the lowest high-tech wage at 24,169. By comparison, the average high-tech wage in Oregon was 54,771, ranking the state fifth. But in another measure, the Evergreen State ranked far lower than one might expect 45th in its share of high-tech exports. Again, Microsoft is the culprit, says Mr. Conway, because the software the Redmond-based company sells often doesn't get counted as merchandise by the U.S. Census Bureau, but rather as a service that requires a license to operate.";1;0

In its first look at first-quarter corporate results, the Commerce Department said that profits, adjusted for the impact of inflation on inventories and depreciation, rose 3.8, slightly slower than the 4 gain recorded in the last months of 1999. Profits were 7.6 higher than they were a year earlier, down from a 9.6 year-over-year change in the fourth quarter of last year. Profit margins, meanwhile, inched up 0.1 to 9.8 for the quarter, but have been relatively flat for the past two years. The peak rate of profit growth is behind us, said David Orr, chief economist with First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. There will still be growth, but at a decelerating rate. The numbers were included in the department's revised first-quarter gross-domestic-product report. In the first three months of the year, GDP -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced by the U.S. economy -- surged ahead at a brisk 5.4 annual rate, confirming the department's earlier estimate. Many analysts had expected the GDP numbers -- which came on the heels of a torrid 7.3 pace in the fourth quarter of last year -- to be revised downward slightly. As in the preliminary report, the data suggest that inflationary pressures continue to build in the economy. The gross- domestic-purchases portion of the GDP figures, which Commerce officials point to as the broadest gauge of inflation in the report, rose 3.2 for the quarter, its sharpest gain in more then ten years. The increase, the same as in the department's earlier estimate, follows a 2.3 gain in the fourth quarter of 1999. The measure tracks increases in the prices paid by companies and individuals.";1;0

The exchanges last month announced plans for a merger that would create a new pan-European exchange called iX and involve a joint venture with the U.S.-based Nasdaq Stock Market, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers. The agreement is subject to approval by owners of 75 of the shares in each exchange in votes expected to be held in September. Officials of the London exchange, known as the LSE, may have trouble winning enough votes from the 298 member firms that own the bourse. In early July, the two exchanges are due to give their owners an information memorandum on the deal, expected to be more than 100 pages long. Indications of its contents could be given to key London bankers tomorrow, when Werner Seifert, who is the chief executive of Deutsche Boerse and would hold the same post at iX, attends a meeting of an LSE committee that helps set trading rules. An LSE spokesman said the document will include projections for the prospects of iX but won't delve into issues beyond the exchanges' immediate control, such as regulation, settlement and the effect of the deal on stock indexes.";1;0
"830982842";"2000-06-21";"How do you translate synergy into French It's a nonsense word, and maybe it's a nonsense concept, too. But Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of Vivendi, is betting his company on the dicey prospect that a transatlantic hodgepodge of European and American assets can indeed produce synergy--and make real money. Messier yesterday delivered the formal announcement of his 34 billion mega-deal to buy the Canadian drinks and entertainment company Seagram, which owns Universal studios and Polygram records. His hope is to make the merged Vivendi Universal into a Paris- based media company that will play in the same monster league with AOL-Time Warner. A comment by Messier at yesterday's press conference made it clear that one factor behind this deal is France's decades-old insecurity about the reach of America's cultural imperialism. For the first time in Europe, there is a communication group of a size that will be able to rival all the American giants, Messier boasted. Maybe so. But many a would-be entertainment baron has stumbled in the pursuit of Hollywood's irresistibly glamorous assets. Just ask the Japanese company Matsushita, which a decade ago was seduced into buying MCA, which it later sold in frustration to Seagram, which Seagram is now selling in frustration to Vivendi. When it comes to the entertainment business, it seems, there always is one more sucker. Even by recent standards of the merger-crazed business world, this one is a high-risk combination. It's premised on the belief that immense scale is essential to compete in today's economy. That remains a shaky proposition, in my book. Insiders say that even before the planned merger with AOL, Time Warner was an almost unmanageable collection of rival princes running their own fiefdoms. Add to that the difficulty of combining Paris and Hollywood--Gerard Depardieu and Julia Roberts--and you have a truly daunting challenge. The chance of the French succeeding in running a U.S. music and film business properly is about zero, one analyst told Reuters news service yesterday. The stock market certainly agrees with that gloomy assessment. Since news of the deal leaked last week, Vivendi's stock has fallen about 22 percent, including a 7 percent drop yesterday, according to the Associated Press. That drop reflects investors' doubts that Vivendi can make enough money from the deal to recover the premium it paid for Seagram, headed by Edgar Bronfman Jr.";0;1

The choice facing policymakers next week, Fed officials say, is between leaving their target for overnight interest rates unchanged or raising them by a quarter of a percentage point. A large majority of investors and analysts are betting rates will not change. The situation was very different when the central bank's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, last met in mid-May. Then, the choice was between raising the rate target by a quarter-point or a half-point. The policymakers opted for the latter, lifting it to 6.5 percent, a cumulative increase of 1.75 percentage points over a period of less than 11 months. But the statement issued at the end of next week's meeting undoubtedly will contain the same language as the one released last month Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. In other words, Fed officials see no reason yet to believe rates are necessarily high enough to slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay. They could well decide at the following meeting, Aug. 22, to raise rates again if new data indicate a rebound in growth.";0;1

The nearly six-point decline in the Conference Board's monthly index of consumer sentiment, to 138.8 from a high of 144.7 in May, strengthens the widely held belief that the Federal Reserve Board won't raise interest rates today.

The May number, revised upward to 144.7 from a preliminary 144.4, equaled the record set in January. The index jumped seven points in May after moving up less than a point in April. We see a little slackening in expectations for businesses, said Lynn Franco, the economist who oversees the New York market research firm's survey of 5,000 households.

When your chief executive, Franklin Raines, used to be President Clinton's budget director and your vice chairman, Jamie Gorelick, is Clinton's former deputy attorney general, it's important for the politically naive numbers nerds on Wall Street to understand that you have a balanced offense. Because from that point on in the call, it was pure politics.

It's late in the congressional session, but a group that includes business, state agencies and labor unions has reached a consensus on long-discussed unemployment-insurance reform. Their proposal would boost state unemployment funds, lower the corporate tax burden and extend benefits to part-time workers. We believe it's possible, says Rich Hobbie, unemployment-insurance director for the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies. The plan calls for tapping billions of dollars generated by a 0.2 payroll surtax that employers have paid since the 1970s. By 1987 the surtax had repaid the loans for which it was levied in the first place. But companies still pay, to the tune of 1.6 billion last year. Under the plan, the surtax would be repealed and state trust funds would receive 11 billion over six years. Part-timers would be eligible for unemployment compensation if they were laid off, and antiabuse measures would be beefed up. But the tax cut and a call to move the program to mandatory status, where it wouldn't compete with other programs for a share of the budget, may draw opposition.

Clinton called on states last year to create the major new benefit, which the Republican-controlled Congress firmly opposed. The measures were introduced amid promises of reshaping the country's work and family policy to meet the needs of what is now a majority of families with two working parents.

The last surviving bill, in Massachusetts, was buried in a study committee yesterday.

Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio registered the biggest gains in per capita income, while the border towns slowed sluggish increases. Per capita income growth is a key economic indicator. When incomes rise briskly, people have more money to spend on everything from restaurant food to housing. In Houston, personal income soared 5.8 in the first quarter over a year earlier as the city's economy rebounded from the low oil prices of 1999. Dallas, which wasn't particularly affected by low oil prices, still saw a strong 5.2 rise during the same period.

"842614348";"2000-08-03";"PHILADELPHIA -- When George W. Bush makes a warm-hearted appeal for support across the political spectrum in his acceptance speech tonight, he will sound compassionate. In other words, he'll sound a lot like Bill Clinton. But compassionate is only half of Mr. Bush's compassionate conservative formula. The conservative half has gotten far less attention here this week, and yet it forms the bedrock of the strategy that Bush advisers will pursue in search of victory in November. The strategy is based on a simple belief There are more conservatives than liberals in the American electorate, and nearly all of them now are Republicans. That's the legacy Ronald Reagan, who wrenched millions of conservatives from their ancestral Democratic homes, bequeathed to today's GOP. From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Bush's first priority has been to keep these conservatives content, and that will continue to be the case through the fall run toward the White House. Despite much advice to the contrary, candidate Bush has refused to shrink from his conservative positions. He's pushing a sweeping tax-cut plan, even though his congressional counterparts have retreated this year in favor of more modest cuts. He's offering a controversial proposal to partially privatize Social Security that many Republicans in Congress dare not touch. And he's resisting popular gun-control measures, despite fierce Democratic attacks. He also brushed off GOP moderates in selecting a solidly conservative, antiabortion running mate in Dick Cheney. The goal to nail down the two core elements of a winning coalition, a phalanx of Southern and Western states and white male voters nationwide. What's most striking about Mr. Bush's strategy is how it has diverged from the theories that many strategists advanced after the Republicans' electoral setbacks of 1996 and 1998. GOP leaders received plenty of advice to soften their conservative positions on issues such as tax cuts, abortion and gun control, even though such moves would anger the party's base. Mr. Clinton, for his part, used just such an approach to break his party's presidential losing streak in 1992, when he ran as a different kind of Democrat who pushed welfare and trade policies at odds with the Democrats' black and labor constituencies.";1;0

The two companies are suspected of acting in concert last month when buying a combined 29 stake in Spanish power company Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico SA in the midst of a takeover battle for Spain's smallest utility. Spanish takeover rules require acquiring companies to launch a bid for 100 of the target company once a 25 stake is acquired. The Spanish Stock Market Commission, or CNMV, will draw up formal charges and take testimony from all three companies during the investigation, which could take months. Both companies' voting rights in Cantabrico have been suspended. If the two utilities are found to be in violation of Spanish securities law, they could face fines of as much as 50 million pesetas 275,200. The CNMV could also force the companies to launch a full takeover bid at 24 euros 21.98 a share, the price of the last, failed bid for Cantabrico. TXU Europe PLC Chairman Phil Tuberville denied any wrongdoing and promised to cooperate with the investigation. At the same time, he insisted that TXU would support any takeover bid of Cantabrico by another company. TXU and Electrabel set off the controversy by jointly acquiring some 15 of Cantabrico from two of its core shareholders, Banco Sabadell and savings bank La Caixa, in early July. In the deal, conducted by investment bank Lazard, TXU acquired an additional 5.25 of the Spanish utility, bringing its total stake to 19.25. Electrabel took a 10 stake in the same operation.";1;0

"830984686";"2000-08-11";"Washingtonians headed south this month, beware. The long, hot season of traffic congestion around Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens is in full swing. This year's tie-up has an interesting twist. A new Busch Gardens exit, including a bridge over Interstate 64, was supposed to open this summer but the project is a full year behind schedule. The exit will benefit tourists and residents by redirecting traffic from clogged roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation explains that its contractor faces a severe shortage of U.S.-made steel for the project. Federal Buy American laws forbid interstate highway projects with federal financing from using imported steel, even if there is no domestic steel available. The restrictions apply equally to the raw material rolled beam or the fabricated product finished girders. A Northern Virginia contractor with whom I spoke said his supplier could use imported rolled beam for the contractor's private projects, but for federal roads projects such as the Interstate 95 exchange at Springfield, the domestic raw material costing 15 to 30 percent more was required. By expensively micromanaging his projects, his firm has steel. Others are scrambling. Guess who ultimately pays the extra cost. Buy American policies are nothing new, and they have a patriotic plausibility to most people. Who could be against saving American jobs In many circumstances they are also innocuous. On the other hand, if they squeeze out imports as intended, they maintain higher prices to American steel users or cause them production delays waiting for backlogged orders to clear. This may save some jobs in favored industries like steel, but at a cost of sales and jobs in American industries that use steel. The benefits this policy provides to the protected steel workers and shareholders come directly out of the pockets of other Americans. This is income redistribution of the worst sort--from average folks to a group that earns substantially more than the manufacturing mean wage. In times of high unemployment, Buy American provisions conceivably can raise domestic demand, thus cushioning a cyclical downturn. But these discriminatory policies are hopelessly inefficient compared with Alan Greenspan's well-oiled monetary policy machine. By the way, has anyone checked the unemployment rate lately What many people do not realize is that the most intense competition American firms face is not with foreign firms but with other American firms in markets for talented labor and scarce capital. Any policy that favors one set of American industries disfavors others. The most important possible exception to this is for policies that are designed to enhance innovation in ways that spill over to other American firms. Buy American policies are not directed toward research and development, and the steel industry is not at the cutting edge of technical progress. Highway construction contractors happily use Komatsu earth-moving equipment and a host of other imported products. So why is USX favored and Caterpillar not The answer, of course, is lobbying power. A large industry spread across a number of important states often gets its way. Alas for the steel industry, its influence isn't what it used to be. The industry employs more than 400,000 fewer workers than it did in 1960. Small, modern mini-mills now provide almost half of domestic output. They have production costs substantially lower than the remaining large-scale integrated mills for which steel protectionism was designed.";0;1

The agreement still faces scrutiny from Congress. But lawmakers have told the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that if they could settle their dispute, Congress would likely adopt their approach. The deal, in which the two have essentially agreed to share regulatory oversight, paves the way to end an 18-year ban on single-stock futures. A futures contract is a promise to deliver or to buy at a set date in the future and at a set price a certain item--pounds of coffee, barrels of oil, or, in this case, stocks or bonds. By law, a futures contract must be traded on an exchange. Once the ban on single-stock futures is lifted, investors could, for example, sell a futures contract based on shares of International Business Machines Corp. to hedge against a decline in the price of the company's stock, or buy such a contract instead of buying the actual IBM shares. Single-stock futures could lower investors' risk by allowing them to hedge against price changes in stocks and bonds.

Take health-care information provider IMS Health. It delivers information on drug sales and trends to pharmaceutical giants, with an amazing 93 market share. But some investors and analysts are reluctant to give the company a clean bill of health because of management-credibility issues. Concerns stem from the odd reverse merger IMS announced this past March with TriZetto, a three-year-old Internet health-care concern with a mere 33 million in annual revenue. Investors couldn't grasp why the venerable information provider -- with 1.4 billion in annual revenue last year -- was looking to merge with the newly public company, which offers medical billing and administrative software online. Amid the pummeling of both companies' shares, the deal was subsequently scratched, although IMS ended up selling a unit to TriZetto.

He has prepared an interactive stock-valuation spreadsheet for investors in which they choose how much of a discount they want to apply.

Calling the euro heavily undervalued, the IMF's new managing director, Horst Koehler, told reporters it is clear that intervention cannot be taboo, because it is part of the instruments any central bank or government has available. The day before, the IMF's chief economist, Michael Mussa, said the conditions ripe for coordinated intervention are rare and added, One has to ask, If not now, when'  The unusually blunt comments from the IMF officials sparked speculation in financial markets that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven big industrialized nations, who are to meet here Saturday, may be preparing to step up the rhetoric about the euro or agree on joint intervention. But the common currency fell to a new intraday low against the dollar of 84.38 cents, suggesting the markets weren't counting on intervention. The euro, born at 1.17 in January 1999, was trading late yesterday in New York at 84.83 cents, down from 85.09 cents Tuesday. The conventional wisdom about currency-market intervention, particularly among U.S. officials, is that it is most likely to succeed when it is coordinated among big economies, announced publicly and catches the markets by surprise. Although G-7 officials appear to agree that the euro is oversold, and by implication that the dollar is unsustainably high, widespread expectations about intervention offer an argument to delay rather than to act now.";1;0

Late in the second quarter, Lewis ran off left guard and broke free for a 45-yard gain.

"830982464";"2000-09-24";"Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls Big-time U, the large public university with high- profile football andor men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels. At many of these institutions, he argues, beer-and- circus--the party scene connected to big-time college sports events-- replaces meaningful undergraduate education. The case he marshals against these places--schools scarcely seems the right word--is overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of higher education in America. Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athletics--Sperber calls Florida State University the national champs of beer and circus, and with ample reason--but it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important. Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him in a previous book, College Sports, Inc. and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, just another number, rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load. Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities and some of the private ones as well are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world. A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni and anyone else who would listen that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News that ambition seems to be universal. But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. In the 1980s, Sperber writes, some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.";0;1

If his firm of 60 employees was going to keep increasing revenue at more than 50 a year, he decided, the space needed to reflect the way his company actually did business. Fast-forward two years to today. Poorly designed cubicles and window-hogging offices are history. In their place is a work space defined by vertical black-metal supports and clusters of glass-walled conference rooms, desktops with low-rise dividers and tables. Laptops and flat-panel computer screens are scattered across work surfaces, which can be quickly reconfigured. Copiers and such are a few steps away, not down the hall and take the second right. People used to play phone tag or wander around the office to set up meetings, Mr. Vernon says. Now three guys working in the same area can just wheel their chairs around a computer terminal.

As thousands of antiglobalization protesters laid siege to the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank here yesterday, Mr. Koehler laid out his vision for the agency responsible for rushing in with big loans and stern advice when a developing nation finds itself in financial crisis. The IMF, Mr. Koehler told top officials from 182 member nations, must make globalization work for the benefit of all. His effort to focus the IMF on emergency loans for better-off developing countries, and on poverty reduction and debt relief for the worst-off, won't convince the IMF's harshest critics, who believe its economic prescriptions favor corporations over the poor and the environment. But his approach is securing him the grudging cooperation of some outside activists and so far, so good kudos from member governments, large and small. The Clinton administration likes his embrace of many of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's reform proposals. The British praise his ability to talk debt relief with antipoverty advocates. The Yemenis applaud when he prods rich countries to open their markets to exports from the developing world. These aren't necessarily the reviews that Mr. Koehler, 57 years old, might have expected. His appointment came after a bitter trans-Atlantic clash. Now, however, Clinton administration officials are warming to Mr. Koehler, who has endorsed many of the IMF reform proposals that Mr. Summers himself first put forth, such as the focus on crisis finance. Just last week the IMF board redesigned its lending programs -- shorter terms and higher rates -- to encourage countries such as Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia to borrow only when they're locked out of private capital markets. Preapproved credit lines are available to countries whose economic policies are judged sound but that might still be hit by contagious market panic.";1;0

After years of downsizing, the number of people directly or indirectly employed by the federal government could grow by about 1 million to reach 18 million over the next five to 10 years, according to Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution. Directly or indirectly responsible for about one-eighth of the jobs in the nation's economy, the government now is poised to expand, no matter whether the electorate chooses George W. Bush or Al Gore as the next president, Light writes in an article in the October issue of Government Executive. According to Light, promises by candidates Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. Bush on defense spending, prescription drug coverage and education will lead to increased staff numbers. Both candidates are making promises that can only be kept by adding to the true size of government, as measured not only by the size of the federal civil service but by the number of employees working indirectly for Uncle Sam under contracts and grants, Light says. Excluding state and local jobs mandated by the federal government, which Light sometimes includes in his numbers, the size of the federal government last year was down nearly 1 million jobs from the beginning of the Clinton administration in 1993. Light has contended previously, and continues to do so in the October article, that the true federal work force includes not just civil service employees but also postal workers, contract workers and grantees, as well as the state and local employees whose work is mandated by the federal government.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday revised its monthly figures for the consumer price index to correct the problem, raising the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.5 percent on an annual basis, for the January through August period. The rate for the so-called core portion of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also lifted by the same amount, to 2.7 percent. Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of labor statistics, said at a press briefing the problem first arose in January 1999 when the agency began using a significantly different sample of housing units to collect rent information. However, she said, the CPI figures for 1999 were not revised because the agency decided the changes were too small to warrant all the problems such a revision would cause for everyone who uses the CPI to adjust benefits, pay, rents and even parts of the tax code for inflation. It would be enormously disruptive for the whole gamut of users of this information if the 1999 figures had been revised, Abraham said, adding that her agency's guidelines for such matters say we should not be revising too far back in time. The agency will not know until next month, when it has the September price figures, whether the changes announced yesterday will affect next year's cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and federal pensions.

The jobless rate for African Americans fell one percentage point to a record low of 7. The numbers tell me that we haven't landed yet and that it's somewhere off in the future, but that we're still on track, said Mark Vitner, an economist with the First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.

That's slightly higher than the 3 and 3.6 consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators. Still, the overall drop in the jobless rate set off alarms at the Federal Reserve, which remains worried that desperate employers will boost wages and benefits to attract or retain workers, triggering inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to slow the economy, though it has kept rates steady at its past three meetings.

That Federal Reserve monetary policy has been too tight, jeopardizing the prospects for a soft landing. Or that a speculative bubble in technology stocks has finally burst. In each case it is assumed that something has changed drastically somehow, for some very important reason, investors now look at the market very differently than they did a few months ago. I believe this view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how stocks are valued. To get back to the basics, over the long run stocks are worth exactly and only an amount equal to the discounted future value of the cash flows investors expect to receive from them. This is usually taken to mean both future dividends and share repurchases that put money back into the hands of stockholders. What most analysts fail to understand when they breathlessly seek out dramatic reasons for major moves in the market is that in this model relatively minor changes in assumptions about interest rates, and the rate of future dividend increases, can create very large shifts in theoretical stock valuations. Take, for example, the 1987 crash. Immediately before the crash, dividends were roughly 3, and interest rates 10. For purposes of simplicity, we shall ignore share repurchases. This means that, given the assumptions of the model, investors before the crash were anticipating that future dividends would grow at a 7 annual rate. What if investors became slightly more conservative For example, as economist Merton Miller has pointed out, if investors in the fall of 1987 increased their forecast for interest rates by only 0.5, and also reduced the rate at which they expected dividends to grow by a similar 0.5, a whopping 25 drop in stock prices would have resulted. In fact, the market fell by 22 on Oct. 19, 1987.";1;0

But the jawboning -- including renewed talk of intervention from one European Central Bank official and a suggestion from a finance minister that the euro could rise 20 -- did little to spur markets to bid up the struggling common currency. In late New York trading yesterday, the euro stood at 82.94 cents, just above its record low of 82.28 cents earlier in the day. Currency-market traders said officials' silence on the euro after a Group of 20 meeting in Montreal prompted the euro's slide to the new low. The ECB will do all it can to achieve its objective of price stability, without excluding the possibility of intervention, said Eugenio Domingo Solans, an ECB executive board member, in Madrid. Mr. Domingo said the solid state of the European economy will sooner or later cause the euro to rise. The weak euro is at the root of inflation in Europe, and doesn't help the economies of the U.S. and Japan either, Mr. Domingo added. Last month the ECB, the U.S. and Japan intervened in the currency markets to prop up the euro, which initially rose but has fallen further in the past two weeks because markets doubt the U.S. would be willing to intervene again before the presidential election. In a sign of how sensitive markets are to the threat of intervention, the euro rose to its high for the day after Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, reiterated what has become the central bank's party line Intervention is a tool at the bank's disposal. Laurent Fabius, France's finance minister, stated the euro has the potential to rise 20. On the whole, Europe is in a positive position. We are not managing to get that across, Mr. Fabius said in Paris. The strong performance of the U.S. economy and perceptions of an inflexible, rigid Europe have contributed to the euro's 29 slide against the dollar since it was founded in January 1999.";1;0

Now comes the hard part Cities and counties from North Carolina's Research Triangle to South Florida must stretch public dollars far enough to please voters by curbing sprawl but not spend so much that they become too financially leveraged in the process. Rising land costs in the region are making that increasingly difficult. Some local government officials project they'll have to spend significantly more than they did in the 1990s to shield only a fraction of the acreage. Land that's most threatened by development tends to be the most expensive to buy. So acquiring even small parcels can rapidly drain a public land-buying bank account, leaving a city or county with little to show for the effort. Moreover, developers and property owners, in selling the increasingly scarce land, often attempt to inflate prices, thinking they can turn a quick profit at taxpayers' expense. Land-buying programs tend to create their own real-estate markets, says Andy Walker, former state director for the Nature Conservancy of Tennessee. With mounting frequency, he adds, cities and counties find themselves having to play hardball with land speculators who think their property is worth a lot more than it really is.

The result of weaker exports is slower overall growth in the U.S., with economists now estimating that gross domestic product rose at a 2 annualized rate in the third quarter of the year, not the 2.7 the government previously had calculated. That would be the slowest growth rate since the U.S. economy limped ahead 0.8 in the second quarter of 1995. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy grew at an estimated 5.2 rate for the year ended Sept. 30.

As you point out, the U.S. outsourcing market is changing and 1999 revenues that were inflated by Y2K and ERP spending are unlikely to reappear anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are many positive trends, including global expansion of outsourcing to offset slower growth in a more mature U.S. market, greater spending on infrastructure, applications management and network services to facilitate the transition to e-business, and an aging federal information technology staff that will accelerate federal sector outsourcing, especially to enable e-government.

At a time when corporate IT departments and governmental agencies alike are confronting a work force nearing retirement, new IT graduates favor established outsourcers and shun the civil service. This will only intensify the trend toward outsourcing. If so, stock investors would be well advised to adopt a longer-term investment horizon.

But they're still anxious that investors, already fretting about a possible U.S. recession and skittish about emerging markets, might react to trouble in the two countries by withdrawing their money from other developing nations.

IMF and U.S. officials say they don't believe the problems have spread yet, although even if they did believe it they would be reluctant to say so aloud for fear of sparking panic. Investors, they say, learned from the Asian crisis not to shun one country just because a neighbor overspends its budget or allows its banks to make unwise loans.

Sales typically slow between the Thanksgiving-weekend crush and the right-before-Christmas panic, and shoppers procrastinate endlessly. But this year, the Dead Zone is more lifeless than ever.

Worried about keeping Internet shoppers engaged and spending, online retailer Amazon.com Inc. extended its free November shipping offer on orders over 100 into December, a move designed to lure customers into purchasing before the last minute. Even giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales were running below plan for the week after Thanksgiving at both its namesake discount stores and its Sam's Clubs division. With the stock market shaky and mounting signs of an economic slowdown, the midseason lull is making retailers particularly edgy this year. Despite a selling sweep on a handful of unexpectedly popular toys, most economists are predicting that holiday sales will be lukewarm, at best, this Christmas. And one big fear is lurking in many retailers' minds that a last minute snowstorm will keep some shoppers from resuming their shopping spree on Dec. 23. Such jitters are exacerbated by the fact that Christmas this year falls on a Monday, giving procrastinators the luxury of an entire weekend to whisk down Main Street or pop over to the mall and scoop up items, many on sale, at the last minute. Except for the odd, annoying relative who finishes holiday shopping in October, most Americans tend to put it off to the very last minute Over the last decade, the busiest shopping day of the year has shifted from the day after Thanksgiving to the Saturday before Christmas. Hopes of a late rush are of little comfort to retailers whose stores right now are full of merchandise but short on holiday shoppers.

Analysts said the report provided further confirmation that growth has slowed recently from the very rapid pace of the first half of this year, which many economists and policymakers regarded as unsustainable. However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump. While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent. It looks pretty favorable to me, said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply. If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect. Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning, Glassman said.

His plea for moderation, while widely noted, was also widely ignored, and the Fed was forced to step in last year and raise interest rates in an effort to slow U.S economic growth to a less threatening pace. Now, four years later to the day, Greenspan was in New York before a group of bankers pleading for moderation once again. This time his concern was about an irrational foreboding that seems to have gripped Wall Street, which Greenspan warned could be a self-fulfilling prophecy if investors refuse to invest and lenders refuse to lend. Signaling an imminent change in Fed policy later this month, he hinted that the Fed was ready to cut interest rates at the first credible signs that the economy was headed for a crash landing.

For 2001, 2.7 percentage points of the raise will go to the former and 1 percentage point to the latter.

And the vocal angst of many investors is what a soft landing sounds like in a spoiled nation that is becoming the crybaby of the Western world. Economic expansions are not like human beings and light bulbs. Expansions do not inevitably expire of natural causes. They could continue indefinitely, absent policy blunders by government or major mistakes by sizable elements of the private sector. The latter sort of mistakes have been made, particularly in overinvestment in technology and dot-com sectors.

The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop. The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth. Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.

Sure, there are plenty of food grains in the world, but most of them are in the West and much of them fed to animals 70 of corn produced in the U.S. is fed to livestock. Perhaps we can solve all the hunger in the world by asking everyone to become vegetarians in the West and then just ask Iowa farmers to donate their grains to the developing world. Export of food from developing countries accounts for only a small percentage of the global food trade, and much of it is in high-value tropical commodities that provide badly needed foreign-exchange for these countries. How does one improve access and distribution of food to the rural poor dependent on farming By improving farm productivity and by enhancing the infrastructure and policies that promote free trade. In South Asia and Africa, where much of the poor in the world live, the large majority of the people are involved in farming. Technologies such as genetically modified crops will help these people not only to produce more food, but also to increase their income. Increased prosperity of the rural sector would clearly help in reducing hunger and in narrowing the inequity between urban and rural people. It is the local production of food and greater income from farm products that can help the rural poor, and biotechnology will help them to reduce the chemical inputs on the farm, reduce labor and fuel, cut down farming costs, produce more nutritious food and improve the overall productivity. Can Messrs. Mittal and Rosset offer any alternative sustainable solutions to global hunger and poverty, or solutions for improving access and distribution of food other than distributing the surplus among those who desperately need it India is also home to me, as it is to Mr. Mittal India has increased food-grain production fourfold since independence in 1947, and a higher percentage of Indians are better fed today than ever before thanks to the Green Revolution.

"842617433";"2001-01-10";"WASHINGTON -- For the first time in years, the dreaded word recession is back as a buzzword. Oddly, though, it will be months -- or even years -- before economists know for sure if the U.S. has entered one, partly because the definition is fluid. The most common definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. This was the explanation President Clinton used to defend his legacy when reporters asked whether President-elect George W. Bush was inheriting a Clinton recession. But that definition isn't widely embraced by economists. Economic growth is sort of more on a continuum, there's nothing special about zero, says Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw. His introductory economics textbook, Principles of Economics, defines a recession more generally as a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment. In some cases, he says, two quarters may be too much. If you had a big enough fall in one quarter, you'd probably call that a recession, too, he says. For professional economists, the ultimate arbiter of economic peaks and troughs is the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee. Basically, a recession is whatever they want to call a recession, says Mr. Mankiw. The NBER is a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank devoted to promoting the understanding of how the economy works. Founded in 1920 and based in Cambridge, Mass., the NBER has been dating expansions and recessions for decades.

Meanwhile, a jump in unemployment claims in California could portend weakness in the country's largest state. The employment-cost index for the fourth quarter of 2000 rose 0.8 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said. That was down from a 0.9 increase in the third quarter and below consensus expectations of a 1.1 rise. It marked the third-straight deceleration in the ECI, a broad survey of labor costs that measures wages and benefits, since it jumped 1.4 in the first quarter of 2000. Overall, Americans' wages and benefits grew by 4.1 for the year, the biggest increase since a 4.3 rise in 1991. Inflation rose more slowly, meaning workers saw real gains in compensation relative to the cost of living. As long as employment costs remain low enough to keep inflation pressures down, say many economists, the message to Federal Reserve policy makers is clear. Despite the tight labor market, I think the Fed has a lot of flexibility in their deliberations on how to cut rates, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.";1;0
"842616477";"2001-01-26";"The U.S. housing market, which helped buoy a sagging economy earlier this winter, took it on the chin in December as home sales tumbled. Sales of existing homes fell 7.4 in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.87 million units, 5.3 below the 5.14-million-unit pace in December 1999. Most economists had expected sales in the range of five million to 5.1 million units. For the full year, home sales totaled 5.03 million units in 2000. That was down 3.2 from 1999, which was a record year for home sales. Economists found the December data troubling, especially when taken with other reports suggesting the market slowed down at year's end. The Commerce Department said last week that while housing starts were up slightly in December, permit applications fell 6.6. Also, the most recent monthly survey by the National Association of Home Builders found builders are less optimistic about the market than before. While all that doesn't add up to a major slowdown, the latest sales data suggest there is a yellow flag for housing, says David Lereah, the realtors' chief economist. Not a red flag yet, but a yellow flag. He says the numbers should help assure that the Federal Reserve will lower rates by at least one-quarter of a percentage point when it meets early next week. Many economists, however, cautioned against placing too much stock in the December data. For one thing, weather was extremely bad, and even though the data are adjusted for that, the formulas used rely heavily on data from recent years when weather was unseasonably warm.";1;0
"842616108";"2001-01-29";"Given that the economy seems to be slowing, the policy heads are furrowing their brows over which would be better -- lower tax rates or lower interest rates. Well, it turns out that both would be best, though neither is likely to run the economy on a dime. -- Taxes. Will lower marginal tax rates spur growth Sure. Low taxes are associated with rapid growth the world around. The Reagan tax cuts, once fully implemented in 1983, ended malaise and started a boom that persisted through 2000, except for a nine-month dip in 1990 and tepid growth as the economy digested the 1990 and 1993 tax increases. We would not now be experiencing growth close to zero, as Alan Greenspan described it in his testimony last week, if we had passed a tax cut last year, when opponents warned that it would overheat the economy, whatever that may mean. And there, in timing, is precisely the rub in using tax changes as countercyclical policy. Given the political delay in crafting tax legislation, tax cuts will arrive at the right time only through blind luck. What's more, taxpayers watching the political tides anticipate tax changes, often in perverse ways. Recall, for example, what happened with the investment tax credit. Expected passage of the credit brought business investment to a halt while the players waited for it to go into effect, just as an anticipated suspension called forth a burst of activity before the suspension was enacted. Both reactions merely aggravated the economic situation the tax credits were meant to remedy. It's better to think of tax policy in structural terms, designing it to produce incentives for growth in the long run. In these terms, cutting marginal tax rates is a no-brainer for one reason -- taxes are way too high. Not only did Mr. Clinton's tax increase create de jure brackets of 15-28-31-36-39.6, but the disallowance of certain deductions and his phase-outs of exemptions make the de facto brackets even higher. In high-tax states like New York and browned-out California, the top combined federal-local marginal rate approaches 50, a level loaded with disincentives and distortions. These higher marginal rates are especially punishing because real bracket creep -- what happens as wages and salaries increase with economic and productivity growth -- pushes more people into higher brackets. As a result federal tax revenue as a percentage of the economy is remarkably fat, at levels last seen in World War II. And the evidence that taxes are way too high is hanging out there for all to see in the form of budget surpluses.";1;0

Mr. O'Neill had argued that lower interest rates, not taxes, were the first line of defense against a slowing economy. He will be pleased if the Fed gratifies widespread expectations and trims its short-term rate target again this week. He also now says he will carry the tax-cut banner with pride. With Bill Clinton out of the way, some congressional Democrats have become tax-cutters as well. The administration of George W. Bush is only in its second week, but all the political harmony in Washington is so unnatural as to be disconcerting. Even the New York Times has overcome its reluctance to admit that Bush is a legitimate president and was marveling Sunday on what a smooth transition the Bushites were conducting. No doubt things would have been even smoother for transition manager Dick Cheney if Al Gore's staffers hadn't trashed the vice presidential offices Mr. Cheney was preparing to occupy. But kids will be kids. The honeymoon won't last, of course. The docility of the Democrats has been prompted in part by fears that the only legacy left behind by the Clinton presidency was a collapsing economy. They would have had to worry less if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had boasted far less that this was an economy they themselves had grown. But the now-departed chief exec and veep were merely behaving like politicians. Don't tell the amiable Democrats this, but their worst fears may not be justified. Even if they are, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore deserve only a part of the blame, just as they deserve only a modicum of credit for the economic surge they claimed as their handiwork when the 20th century was going out like a lion. The late 1990s boom was the product of an entrepreneurial, high-tech explosion in which productivity rose dramatically and a new consumer product, the personal computer, came into its own. Last fall, the boom simply ran out of gas after consumers had used up most of their credit and corporations could no longer keep stock prices pumped up by borrowing money to buy up their own shares. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, held in check by Congress, were not able to contribute much to the debacle. That's if you don't count the not inconsiderable regulatory mischief they inflicted before making their rather ungracious departures. Or their resistance to tax-cut proposals that, if enacted a year ago, might have headed off the current slowdown. It's a bit early to grant them absolution, particularly with regard to energy policy, but a little generosity never hurts.";1;0

At seminars and panel discussions held in a fortress-like conference center surrounded by armed guards and barbed wire, they were confronted by a staccato burst of statistics depicting the monstrous inequalities of our age that more than a billion people live on less than 1 a day, that half of humanity has never made or received a phone call and that Manhattan has more Internet connections than all of Africa. But as they descended today from the snowy alpine peaks, there was an air of disappointment among many of the 2,000 participants who were brought together by the World Economic Forum to ponder how to Bridge the Divides. When people talk about globalization, what we see is a world that is divided into two, said Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president. There is a structural fault of poverty on one side, there are the powerful and the wealthy, and on the other side, there are the powerless and the poor. The exhilarating promises of globalization -- of new technologies, the elevation of living standards through free trade and the global web of mutual interests that was supposed to render wars obsolete -- have given way to fresh suspicions about the need to shatter traditions and break down the last barriers to the flow of capital, people and ideas. Given the growing hostility to globalization, Mexico's new reformist president, Vicente Fox, said the world's industrial democracies need to acknowledge that the present methods of reaching out to the illiterate and the impoverished are simply not working. Instead of bridging the divide, he said, the chasm between rich and poor is only getting worse.";0;1

"830982085";"2001-02-01";"It's been difficult to pin an ideological tail on the nascent Bush White House. One day the president is called a staunch conservative for nominating John D. Ashcroft to run the Justice Department and acting to restrict U.S. funding to overseas groups that support abortions. The next he's labeled a bleeding heart for helping prisoners' children and promoting literacy programs. The problem, some Bush advisers and friends say, is that conventional political definitions do not adequately explain what the president is trying to do. His actions have less to do with the left vs. right, they say, than with his embrace of many of the ideas contained in the movement known as communitarianism, which places the importance of society ahead of the unfettered rights of the individual. This is the ultimate Third Way, said Don Eberly, an adviser in the Bush White House, using a favorite phrase of President Bill Clinton, who also sought, largely unsuccessfully, to redefine the debate with an alternative to the liberal-conservative conflict. The debate in this town the last eight years was how to forge a compromise on the role of the state and the market. This is a new way to rethink social policy a major reigniting of interest in the social sector. Communitarianism, or civil society thinking the two have similar meanings has many interpretations, but at its center is a notion that years of celebrating individual freedom have weakened the bonds of community and that the rights of the individual must be balanced against the interests of society as a whole. Inherent in the philosophy is a return to values and morality, which, the school of thought believes, can best be fostered by community organizations. We need to connect with one another. We've got to move a little more in the direction of community in the balance between community and the individual, said Robert D. Putnam of Harvard University, a leading communitarian thinker. Many of Bush's early proposals fit this approach. This week, Bush moved to make it easier for the government to fund religious groups that cater to the poor and disadvantaged. He also gave a boost to AmeriCorps, the national service program that sends volunteers to help community initiatives. Last week, Bush rolled out an education plan that gave localities more authority over their schools. A week earlier, he spoke of the need for character education in schools. Even his tax plan, due next week, has what are touted as community- building elements a new charitable tax credit, a charitable deduction for those who don't itemize, and a reduction of the marriage penalty. Bush's inaugural address, said George Washington University professor Amitai Etzioni, a communitarian thinker, was a communitarian text, full of words like civility, responsibility and community. That's no accident Bush's advisers consulted on the speech with Putnam. At the same time, Bush has recruited some of the leading thinkers of the civil society, or communitarian, movements to his White House former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith, University of Pennsylvania professor John DiIulio, fatherhood advocate Eberly, speechwriters Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner. Even Lawrence B. Lindsey, long before becoming Bush's economics adviser, was a Federal Reserve governor who explored ways to lure capital to rebuild poor urban communities.";0;1

But the Midwest, bogged down in a manufacturing slowdown, is catching up quickly. Those are among the highlights of a report released yesterday by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on so-called mass layoffs, where companies terminate 50 or more employees at once, and the employees file for unemployment insurance. The report indicated that while mass layoffs started 2000 little changed from a year earlier, layoffs rose 54 for the fourth quarter from a year earlier as a slowing economy prompted big companies to make sharp cuts in their work forces. In the October to December period, there were 5,248 mass-layoff events involving 647,012 workers, compared with 3,943 events and 420,827 workers a year earlier. For the entire year, there were 15,738 mass-layoff events affecting 1.84 million workers, compared with 14,909 events affecting 1.57 million in 1999. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of the job cuts occurred in manufacturing, which accounted for 35 of all layoff events and 42 of all workers. Virtually everyone has been willing to admit that the manufacturing sector is miserable the question now is whether that weakness spreads out to other areas of the economy, said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. The distribution of mass layoffs on a state-by-state basis showed some surprising results. Partly as a result of an unfolding energy crisis, declining sales of technology equipment and the dot-com blowout, California reported nearly 155,000 mass layoffs for the fourth quarter, a 14 jump from a year earlier.

Harris Interactive surveyed 2,948 people online before the Super Bowl about whether they planned to watch the big game and the ads, and about their overall impression of Super Bowl advertising. The pollsters went back to those people after Sunday's game to find out if they watched the hyped ad campaigns as closely as expected. The pollsters conducted a total of 938 postgame interviews.

"830983574";"2001-02-04";"Jasper Becker is Beijing bureau chief for a Hong Kong newspaper, the South China Morning Post, which covers China more extensively than any other English-language paper does. Reporting from China most of the time since 1985, he has been everywhere and asked every question. A few years ago he published a well-regarded book on China's great famine of the 1960s. Now he has pulled together much of his own reporting and that of his Post colleagues to offer a corrective to the outside world's generally sunny view of China today. Becker focuses first on poverty-stricken minority peoples living in regions distant from the coast and on peasants in hilly and dry regions. Then he moves chapter by chapter to the cities, and up the ladder from factory workers to private entrepreneurs, bureaucrats and finally the top leaders. As he gets closer to the coast and to Beijing, he brings consumerism and intellectual sophistication into view. He emphasizes how recent China's consumer revolution is, and throws doubt on the argument that the Internet and faxes will pry Chinese society from the grip of the authoritarian state. A common view in the West -- and a principle behind the China policies of both Bush pegrvre and Bill Clinton -- was that economic opening and growth would improve human rights in China. Becker shows that this optimism has been largely unjustified. Beneath the back- slapping, banqueting and cell-phone networking of private-enterprise China he sees the pathologies of a sick society unemployment, nepotism, corruption and political repression. Many Chinese are worse off, even though GDP per capita has increased. The welfare system has collapsed, the state enterprises are even hollower than they're commonly understood to be, workers have lost job security, and the traditionally dismal terms of trade between the countryside and the cities have worsened. Private entrepreneurs flourish at the sufferance of the state but fall victim to predatory officials and shifts in government policy, and even on the most optimistic projections cannot create enough jobs to soak up China's surplus labor power. Police repression has tightened The individual freedoms bruited in the West are restricted to matters of lifestyle, which do not include politics or religion. The 600 million Chinese peasants, says Becker, are the largest unenfranchised group in the world. Becker's reporting is at its best where China is at its worst. Even among specialists, I do not think the collapse of China's health system has been portrayed as incisively as Becker does it here. He is convincing on the sorry state of rural education, although I think he underestimates strengths at the university level, and he is scathing and correct on the often overpraised reforms of the justice system. Some details Becker gets wrong. It's not fair to say that China has annexed the South China Sea or that China acts as if it has no international obligations other than to ethnic Chinese. It's not true that the National People's Congress has no permanent staff or offices or that Deng Xiaoping had no official post in 1989 except chairman of the Chinese Bridge Association in fact, Deng's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission was crucial to his role in the events of that year. The prediction that Taiwan will help fund the Chinese democracy movement and hence determine China's future strikes me as misguided in two ways -- because the Taiwanese avoid involvement in mainland politics, and because change is more likely to come from within the ruling Communist Party than from the dissident movement.";0;1

The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 in January, its highest level since September 1999 but only a bit above the near-30-year low of 4 in December, the Department of Labor said Friday. In January, the labor pool expanded faster than the number of new jobs that were created. Payrolls outside of farming jumped 268,000 in January, adjusted for seasonal variation, well above what economists expected, and a big improvement over the tiny increase of 19,000 jobs in December. That increase was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 105,000. The January data suggest that employment, especially in construction where 145,000 jobs were added, had been unusually depressed by bad weather in December. The report was the first comprehensive look at the entire economy for January. Previous reports had found that the industrial sector's decline accelerated during the month, and the payroll report provided further confirmation. Manufacturing jobs sank by 65,000, bringing total losses in that sector to 254,000 since June. But employment in retail trade, government and other services rose 183,000.

In 20 states where judges have agreed -- and in a handful of others -- legislators have tried to share the wealth. Some states now use statewide property or sales taxes to pay for a greater proportion of their school costs.

In a conference call with institutional investors who hold about 20 of AT&T's stock outstanding, representatives from the AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of America said the plan to break AT&T into four separate pieces is flawed and will hurt investors in the long run. The AFL-CIO, through its Capital Stewardship Program, works with 1,500 union-sponsored pension funds that collectively hold 25 million AT&T shares. Other participants in the call included representatives of banks and public-employee retirement funds, among others, who together hold 680 million of about 3.75 billion AT&T shares outstanding. Michael Garland, of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, told the investors that AT&T's decision to break the company into pieces was prompted by management's inability to execute on its original strategy of selling a bundle of telecommunications services.

"842616651";"2001-02-13";"The electricity market in California has swung over its history from monopolization by industrialists in its early days to comprehensive regulation, then to partial deregulation in the 1990s, and now back toward substantial regulation and government intervention. In the past, each swing of the pendulum came from public frustration with the way this market operated, and each produced a result that the public again found unsatisfactory. But the memory of politicians and the public is short. The state is poised to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle of regulation. Measures passed by the California Legislature this month are an ill-conceived intervention that will lock the state into high energy costs and put it at a competitive disadvantage for years to come. Unless there is further action, the state will maintain subsidized retail prices that discourage conservation, while capping in-state wholesale prices in a manner that discourages construction of new in-state generation capacity and leaves Californians at the mercy of out-of-state generators. Government subsidization of electricity consumption will drain tax revenues that might be better used for education and other needs, encumber California's children with debt to pay the state's energy bills, and threaten the state's future ability to sell bonds for public projects. The immediate political cost of consumer outrage from higher electricity rates may be postponed, but the real economic cost promises to be massive. The sad thing is that this is all unnecessary. The source of the crisis was rigid regulation of retail prices in the face of rapid increases in wholesale prices driven by increased fuel prices and increased demand in the national electricity market. The only effective solution to the crisis is to make retail price regulation more flexible, so that consumers see the real economic cost of electricity and respond to high prices through conservation efforts that reduce demand and push prices down. On the supply side, the state should encourage construction of new in-state generation capacity through the right market signals, giving producers the opportunity to site plants and sell power under conditions comparable to other states.";1;0

Despite the late slowdown, figures released yesterday showed Mexico's economy easily beat the government's 4.5 target to grow 6.9 for the year as a whole, its fastest annual growth since 1981. The economy was helped by oil prices at a decade-high, a growing U.S. appetite for Mexican exports, and spending by Mexican consumers who enjoyed wage gains greater than price increases. This year's outlook under new President Vicente Fox Quesada is more uncertain, thanks to a recent drop in oil prices and a fast-slowing U.S. economy, where roughly 85 of Mexican exports are sold. Industrial output for December, the latest barometer of activity, slipped slightly after double-digit growth for much of the year. Some economists welcome a slowdown as a way to prevent prices from rising too quickly. But they note that the drop in industrial output doesn't necessarily mean that Mexicans are spending less. If spending on imports remains strong while Mexican factories export less, they note, the trade deficit could widen, weakening the currency. A slowdown for Mexico is inevitable, said economist Gray Newman at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The risk is that production slows substantially and spending does not.";1;0

Gramlich said yesterday in a speech in London. Instead, the new, higher rate of growth in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- appears likely to last even as economic growth slows, Gramlich said. After the speech, he told reporters that U.S. productivity growth was still accelerating in the first nine months of last year, the Dow Jones news service reported. When economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, productivity growth did as well, but only modestly. So it looks like productivity is hanging in there even with our slowdown, the Fed board member said. Gramlich told the International Bond Congress that numerous studies indicate that the long-term trend in productivity growth increased in the United States from about 1.5 percent annually during the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s to about 2.5 percent more recently. That acceleration was caused primarily by two things, he said.";0;1

Peter Fisher is no stranger to the kind of turmoil he would likely face as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance. In his current job as executive vice president in charge of markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the 44-year-old Mr. Fisher watches global credit and currency markets for potential signs of trouble. Associates describe the red-haired, cherubic Mr. Fisher as an activist willing to use the government's powers to pre-empt or snuff out financial trouble. In 1998, he engineered the controversial Fed-brokered bailout of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, persuading skeptical regulators that the alternative could have been an international financial meltdown. Mr. Fisher would join a Treasury team that is facing its first potential financial crisis in Turkey's emergency devaluation of its currency. Though Mr. Fisher has yet to get formal White House clearance, Mr. O'Neill has settled on him as his choice, according to people familiar with the nomination. His appointment would require confirmation by the Senate. Neither Mr. Fisher nor a Treasury spokeswoman would comment. The Fisher choice underscores the tremendous influence that Mr. Greenspan seems to be building in the new administration. The Fed chairman worked with the new Treasury secretary during the Ford administration, and Mr. O'Neill has frequently turned to his longtime friend for advice on economic policy. Mr. Greenspan also appears to have succeeded in persuading the Bush administration to reappoint Roger Ferguson as Fed vice chairman.";1;0

Two other reports on last month's new orders for durable goods -- such as cars, appliances, computers and machinery -- and sales of new homes, showed much less weakness and were not nearly as disturbing to analysts as what has been happening to consumer attitudes. Falling stock prices, high heating bills, worries about job prospects and a drumbeat of gloomy statements about the economy from Wall Street analysts, company executives and the White House have taken a big toll on consumers' expectations. If they were to pull back on their spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic output, the already weak economy could slide into a recession. The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell to 106.8, down 25 percent from its level of five months ago. But the overall index is a composite of two measures of how consumers regard their present economic situation and what they expect it to be like six months from now. The present-situation index has declined 10 percent since September, while the expectations reading has plunged 40 percent. The erosion in consumer confidence continues to be fueled by weakening expectations regarding business and employment conditions, said Lynn Franco, director of the board's Consumer Research Center.

The Fed report, known as the beige book, suggests demand has eased, mostly for the best-paid workers -- those in high-tech, Internet, manufacturing, and construction jobs -- while demand for entry-level, clerical and health workers has remained strong. The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, uses the report on business conditions around the country to help set the direction for interest rates. The FOMC is expected to cut interest rates by half a percentage point when it meets March 20, an expectation that appeared validated by the Fed report's finding that most regions reported sluggish to modest economic growth in February. A month ago, a Fed survey found a substantial portion of banks tightening lending standards, a development that could exacerbate the current slowdown.

To be sure, manufacturing is in recession, but the rest of the economy is alive and kicking, said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Bank. Even in autos, where two-thirds of the layoffs in manufacturing have occurred, 13,000 more jobs were created last month. Adjusted for the volatility in weather, construction is in the process of stabilizing and gaining momentum, Sohn said. Services, which account for about 80 percent of jobs, are healthy.

A good time might be right now. Perhaps Alan Greenspan had stopped tightening just in time to engineer a soft landing, I speculated, but if this rosy scenario did not materialize he may be short of maneuvering room. Oil prices were already signaling that a downturn could well be accompanied by a danger of inflation. So if George W. Bush actually won, his tax proposal may be on the table none too soon. This has pretty much worked as advertised, except that it's too bad George W. Bush didn't propose a stimulative tax cut. Well of course, the tax proposal President Bush sent to Congress is the same one candidate Bush had on the table in October. And with its attention to across-the-board marginal rate reductions, it certainly was a stimulative one when compared with Al Gore's tax proposal, a hodgepodge of spending programs in drag. But the economic downturn has become much clearer. Perhaps the economy will yet rebound in the second half leading indicators rose in January after three months of decline, and Friday's employment figures were encouraging. Still, with earnings declines and even layoffs spreading, stimulus soon would be only prudent. The Fed stepped up to the plate by lowering its short-term interest rate target, but the president has made no similar adjustment in his tax proposal. In the current environment, its long phase-in can no longer be overlooked. Experience warns that tax cuts usually stimulate only when they become effective. A phase-in creates incentives to delay income, perhaps making a downturn worse.";1;0

With the LDP apparently bereft of ideas for fixing the economy, Mr. Mori's meeting with the Bush team could prove important. Even if the Japanese PM is a lame duck, American advice will be conveyed back to the inner circle.

So what advice should he offer Even among those who recognized the futility of Japan's deficit spending, there has always been much disagreement over what should replace it. Monetarists and some demand-side economists have emphasized the damage that deflation and deflationary expectations have done to the economy.

The answer is that there is no single answer No cookie-cutter solution fits all. It may well be time for people nearing retirement to cut back on stocks, but it wouldn't be smart to do it in one fell swoop. The right move for you depends on several factors, notably your age, your life expectancy and -- this is key -- whether you have enough cash on hand to avoid dumping stocks at low prices if you encounter more bad stock-market years immediately after you retire. To provide some guidance, Encore talked with a number of financial advisers who specialize in retirement. Here's what we found The Lessons of History";1;0

Wall Street may well be disappointed. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has promised that the central bank will respond aggressively to the abrupt slowing of U.S. economic growth, but it's far from clear exactly what that means in the swirling crosscurrents of the U.S. and world economies. Furthermore, the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, has most often changed its rate target in quarter-point increments, and a half-point could be considered aggressive. A survey of 121 analysts and economists completed yesterday by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial markets research firm, found that nearly two-thirds of them believe the Fed will cut the 5.5 percent target by only half a point. Less than a third are looking for three-quarters, while a half dozen said the Fed would slash rates by a full percentage point. I think they are going to go half a point, said Charles Lieberman, chief economist for Advisers Financial, a money- management firm. The recent economic data actually suggest some improvement in the economy. Consumer spending has been better than expected, including for cars, and auto companies have boosted production plans for the second quarter. A larger cut could lead some people to conclude that The Fed must know about some problems that we don't, and then the markets might sell off even more, Lieberman said. And I don't think they will want to encourage anyone to think they are doing it to support the stock market.";0;1
"842615164";"2001-03-21";"WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration may be having its cake and eating it too when it comes to government projections about economic growth. As the White House pushes its big tax-cut package, administration and congressional budget analysts predict boom times ahead that would generate giant revenue surpluses. But in a recent trustees' study on the solvency of Social Security and Medicare -- programs President Bush has targeted for major retooling -- the administration paints a picture of modest economic growth and flagging worker productivity. Some officials say this is largely a consequence of having separate bureaucracies prepare the economic forecasts for the budget and for the big entitlement programs. But the policy-making implications can be dramatic. For example, if the Social Security trustees' assumptions are basically correct, the overall budget surplus predicted by the Congressional Budget Office could drop by as much as 1.75 trillion from its current projected 5.6 trillion -- or about the amount Mr. Bush is seeking in his tax-cut package, economists said.";1;0

A ruthless restructuring has moved into its final phase in the past 10 days as three local telecom companies threw in the towel, starting what is projected to be the biggest industry implosion since real estate developers took down the savings and loan industry a decade ago. E.spire Communications Inc. of Herndon has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Metrocall Inc. of Alexandria says it may have to do the same. PSINet Inc. of Ashburn is trying to avoid it, but isn't given much chance by industry insiders. More local companies are lined up behind them. Each of these companies was set up to serve a different piece of the telecommunications market. E.spire was into local and long- distance voice. Metrocall sold wireless paging. PSINet's specialty was high-speed Internet services. Stockholders of this trio of companies have seen 14 billion in stock market value wiped out.

"842615909";"2001-03-29";"The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Fannie Mae has threatened several large financial services firms that had opposed Fannie's interests in Congress. According to statements by the CEOs of AIG, Wells Fargo and GE Capital Services, they, or their firms, were told that Fannie would withdraw its business from them if they remained active in FM Watch, an organization that seeks to limit Fannie's expansion beyond its traditional role in the secondary mortgage markets. Fannie's chairman Franklin Raines, as well as a Fannie spokeswoman, have both denied that such threats were made, but when CEOs of major companies go public with statements of this gravity they must be taken seriously. This is not an ordinary commercial dispute, since Fannie Mae is not an ordinary company. Along with its smaller cousin, Freddie Mac, Fannie enjoys a government charter authorizing it to help create liquidity in the residential mortgage markets by purchasing mortgages from banks and others and guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities. Although both Fannie and Freddie are now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, they have so many links to government -- including a special line of credit at the Treasury -- that they are called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. As a result, the capital markets do not believe they will be allowed to fail, and provide them with financing at a rate only slightly higher than the Treasury's own borrowing costs. With this government backing and financial advantage, Fannie and Freddie have grown to enormous size and profitability. Today, they carry on their books the credit risk of over 40 of all residential mortgages in the U.S. and are by far the most dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. It is fair to say that if a company is denied the opportunity to sell its mortgages to Fannie or Freddie, or the opportunity to underwrite or deal in Fannie or Freddie securities, it will suffer serious financial harm. If Mr. Raines or Fannie did threaten these companies, that is the reason why his threat was menacing. Fannie Mae is to the residential mortgage markets what Microsoft is to computers, with one major exception Fannie enjoys government backing. Fannie's market power derives from its government connection -- from the fact that it holds, in effect, a government monopoly. A threat from Fannie's chairman, then, is roughly equivalent to the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board threatening to ruin a bank that opposes the Fed in Congress. Such a threat would be seen as a serious matter, out of order for a government official and considerably more serious than the threats that Microsoft is alleged to have made against rivals. This episode should alert us to dangers inherent in GSEs. They are sometimes praised as providing private-sector efficiency in the pursuit of government policies, without direct government expenditure. Unfortunately, the true costs are hidden or deferred. In the mid-1980s, Congress had to spend billions to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. And the costs are often not simply financial. While we value the aggressiveness and efficiencies of private enterprises in their pursuit of profit, when these characteristics are hitched to the power of the government through a government-granted monopoly, they can dominate and distort otherwise competitive markets.";1;0

The 1 billion school spending plan was a key part of Curry's annual budget presentation, a proposal he touted for containing none of the service cuts or tax increases contemplated in neighboring areas. That's a whole lot of zeroes, Curry D said at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, referring to the money for schools. Nevertheless, the school increase was far less than the 158 million boost that Board of Education officials had requested. And Curry's proposal contained no money to reduce class sizes, something that Schools Superintendent Iris T. Metts listed as her top priority. Curry said it would be unwise to spend money on hiring more teachers to cut class sizes when there isn't enough classroom space. But school board members, who had requested 11.5 million for the initiative, say it can be accomplished by assigning two teachers to a single class.";0;1

Under the parliamentary system, Blair can choose the date for national elections. He is said to be eager to dissolve Parliament and hold an election quickly, with May 3 as his preferred date. Blair has to decide by Monday, and he's receiving conflicting advice from across the political spectrum. A choice that once seemed almost automatic has suddenly emerged as a crucial test of Blair's political instincts and courage. While most members of Blair's governing Labor Party appear to favor a May election, several have joined the call for a delay until the farm crisis has been controlled. William Hague, leader of the chief opposition Conservative Party said today that a May election would be an arrogant choice that puts the interests of one party ahead of the country. In the rural communities worst hit by the epidemic, farm groups are bitter at the very thought of a May election. There's a sense that he's throwing us over the side to advance his own political agenda, said Mike Downham, a livestock farmer in the northern county of Cumbria. Rural voters generally don't back Labor, so Blair presumably wouldn't lose many votes if he angered farmers. But if city and suburban voters decide that it is callous to mount a campaign during a crisis, that could cost the Labor Party votes it badly needs, both in the parliamentary election and in the hundreds of city and county elections also scheduled for May 3.";0;1

Looking at the carnage on Wall Street, new retirees may wonder why anyone would tell them to get deeply involved in stocks. But that is precisely what some financial advisers suggest. The reason, of course, is that the advisers are not reacting to what the stock market is doing at the moment they're talking about what the market is going to do in the next 15 or 20 years. History is clear on this point. Sooner or later, stocks will recover and prices will rise. When that happens, stocks will again generate the gains that retired investors need for their long-term financial health. Of course, for older retirees who invest in stocks, it's hard not to worry. Thus far, my stock losses are still on paper. But I will admit that, at the age of 74, it is pretty scary to realize that if I had to sell some of my battered stocks anytime soon, my paper losses would become actual losses. I sometimes wonder if I should dump my stocks and flee to bonds. However, experience has taught me that it would be a bad idea. When you sell at the bottom, you lock in your losses. And then, when the market turns around and those stocks go back up, you no longer own them and you don't get any of the gains. So you lose both ways.";0;1

January income was revised to a gain of 0.5, down from the 0.6 pace previously estimated. Consumer spending in January was revised to a gain of 1, up from the 0.7 gain first reported. In another indication that consumers may be counted on to keep the economy growing, even while manufacturing flails, a widely watched barometer of consumer confidence rose in March after three months of declines. The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index, which measures current and future economic expectations, rose to 91.5 last month from 90.6 in February, according to people familiar with the report. Analysts had expected a lower reading because of the recent stock-market turmoil. But a separate report Friday gave further evidence of the sharp slowdown among U.S. businesses. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of business activity in the Midwest fell to 35.0 in March, its lowest level in 19 years. Any number below 50 signals that business in the manufacturing sector is contracting. Analysts had expected a reading of 43.5, slightly higher than the 43.2 level reported for February.

China's continued insistence on a full apology carries substantial risks for the Chinese president, officials associated with him and for China, the analysts said. Jiang really doesn't have many cards to play, said one Chinese political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. By setting his price so high for the Americans -- an apology -- he is probably going to fail, whatever the outcome. Jiang and the rest of the Communist Party are in a struggle over who will lead China into the future. A misstep by Jiang while simultaneously managing relations with the United States and dealing with potential opponents at home could result in his being eased from the political stage, Chinese officials speculated. Thus, the Bush administration must decide how much it wants to bolster the 74-year- old technocrat, who has made strong U.S.-China relations a hallmark of his government.

I specifically don't want to introduce a bias in our public utterances or statements, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said at a news conference. So you keep on waiting and we keep on seeing. Mr. Duisenberg further brushed off pressure to cut by saying a series of seven rate increases up until last October resulted in the disappearance of inflationary risks over the medium term. But having achieved that does not mean that we have to also reverse the course. Rate cuts in the U.S. and Japan three weeks ago, coupled with a softer tone on inflation from some of the ECB's most influential officials, sparked speculation the ECB would trim at least a quarter point from its key rate of 4.75 at yesterday's meeting. Now economists believe the ECB will keep rates steady until May or even June, remaining the only major central bank to stand still in the face of the global slowdown. The ECB sets interest rates for the 12 nations using the euro -- the world's second-largest economy.

As a result, dealers say they are paying substantially more than their competitors for gasoline, forcing them to either boost retail prices or sustain losses. It isn't clear how long Tosco will hold out, however, if competitors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. don't match the increases. We will pursue every business practice the market will allow us to do.

Although Tosco posted record profit from refining operations in the fourth quarter, much of that achieved in California, the company says marketing income has sagged. So far, competitors haven't matched the price increases, but Tosco dealers and others in Arizona and Southern California believe they must be tempted.

If the estimates hold up, it will be the sharpest drop since the 1990-91 recession. Second-quarter earnings are also expected to tumble 7 and the third-quarter outlook, while still barely positive, is rapidly deteriorating. That's a big departure from 1999 and 2000, when year-over-year quarterly operating profits frequently grew more than 20. But some economists say the current decline doesn't begin to tell the full story of what's in store in the coming years. They say that even once the economy rebounds and earnings start growing again, the outsized profit gains of 1999 and 2000 are a thing of the past. Profits in the 1990s, they say, grew out of sync with the rest of the economy, lifted temporarily by tame debt and labor costs, accounting quirks and technology investments that might never yield significant returns. They say a reversion to the mean is in the works that will translate into a period of profit gains that, at best, are in the single digits.

Accused of foot-dragging on the matter of priming a sluggish economy, Greenspan now seems in a full-speed-ahead mood to get things moving again. But the Fed's action also is a sign of how worried the economic masters of the universe are about our nation's slowdown. In the dry language of Fedspeak, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. If a good inflation-phobe like Greenspan believes this, it's hard for anyone to disagree. The question is whether our sustained national experiment with very low unemployment is about to end. The unemployment rate has spiked up, and the news of layoffs suggests the numbers are likely to get worse this year. For all the media focus on stock prices, it's unemployment that has real human and social impact.

Until parts of the stock market began to head south a year ago, Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials were being hailed as geniuses.

The growth of productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- appeared to have shifted into a higher gear, raising U.S. living standards in the process. And the nation's unemployment rate was down to nearly 4 percent, a rate previously believed possible only in a world of increasing inflation. And that low rate meant that many Americans with fewer skills and low incomes were able to find jobs where none had been available before.

Bond investors always fear that returns on fixed-income securities such as Treasurys could be eroded in the long term if stronger growth is accompanied by higher inflation.

Companies such as Hartford Financial Services Group, Lincoln National and Nationwide Financial Services saw assets in variable annuities, which are essentially mutual funds in an insurance wrapper, shrink last year, due to poor stock-market performance and, for most companies, shrinking net sales figures. And unlike securities brokerage firms and mutual-fund firms with stock-market exposure, insurers have an added layer of risk. In recent years, many have essentially locked in certain levels of stock-market returns of their policyholders. Now, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq Composite Index 20 and 59 off their highs of last year, respectively, some of those promises are coming back to haunt the sellers.

Morgan Stanley issued a report earlier this month estimating variable-annuity sales declined another 14 in the first quarter, and predicting a further 10 decline this quarter. In the same report, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Dally says the sales decline would make it difficult for Lincoln National to achieve its goal of positive net cash flows in its individual variable-annuity business by year end.

Friedman sniffed the anti-globalization movement is largely the well intentioned but ill informed being led around by the ill intentioned and well informed. What the ignorant and malign anti-globalists do not understand, Friedman lectured, is that global trade expansion is the only route out of poverty for the world's poor -- not only a commercial good but a moral one too. Friedman's assessment is important because he is as close as there is to the voice of the globalization establishment. The establishmentarian view, as it has evolved in the face of increasing criticism, is that globalization is great not only because it creates wealth in the developed countries but because it functions as a sort of super-missionary, spreading both wealth and freedom among the less blessed nations of the earth. Last week in Quebec, George W. Bush summed up the perceived wisdom We seek freedom not only for people living within our borders but also for commerce moving across our borders. Free and open trade creates new jobs and new income. It lifts the lives of all our people, applying the power of markets to the needs of the poor. . . . And open trade reinforces the habit of liberty. This argument is true as far as it goes. As Friedman's paper is currently reporting in a series on free trade, the blessings of unfettered commerce are a great deal less than munificent but trade does bring jobs -- sweatshop jobs, gutter-level jobs, but still jobs - - to places where there were no jobs before. And, indeed, free trade has historically pulled freedom in its wake although, as China is proving, this need not necessarily be so. The problem with this argument is that it is a very fat herring of the reddest hue. It is beside the central political, economic and moral point of the whole debate. President Bush gave the game away in unscripted remarks on his proposal to create a hemispheric Free Trade Area of the Americas at last, truly the world's largest shopping mall. Addressing demands that participating countries adhere to minimum standards of worker treatment and environmental protection, Bush said the agreement certainly must not contain codicils to destroy the spirit of free trade. He added While I understand that some unionists are interested in making sure there's labor protections, I don't want those labor protections to be used to destroy the free trade agreement.";0;1

The problem is rooted in the nation's piecemeal, poorly thought-out utility-deregulation process, which planted time bombs that could continue to explode across the nation for years to come. Deregulation in the '90s prodded many utilities to sell off power plants and then to sign long-term contracts to buy back the output. Now, those contracts are expiring. That will mean utilities are going to be buying electricity at much higher prices on the open market -- at a time when ownership of power plants is increasingly concentrated in relatively few hands. Another big problem The transmission lines that carry electricity are growing old and overloaded. But in the chaotic world of deregulation, few have sufficient financial incentive to upgrade the lines. The result In some parts of the country there may be no way to deliver enough power when and where it's needed most. While the rest of the country is in better shape than California, some ominous clouds are already gathering. Supplies in several regions are tight. Prices are rising sharply, affecting not only consumers in the 24 states that have already been deregulated but even some in states that haven't. An ill-timed heat wave from Maine to Pennsylvania could plunge parts of the Northeast into a power crisis. The breakdown of a few big power plants in the West could reverberate through nearly a dozen states. Whole chunks of the country, in other words, are balancing on the knife's edge between scant sufficiency and outright shortage, says Douglas Logan, a principal at energy firm RDI Consulting in Boulder, Colo.";1;0

The 'darkness' of the book's title refers to the monstrous passions at the core of the human soul, lying ready to emerge when man's better instincts are suspended. . . . Conrad was more preoccupied with rotten Western values, the white man's inhumanity to the black man, than, as is almost always assumed today, black savagery.

What happened in Zaire had its roots in a history of extraordinary outside interference, as basic in motivation as it was elevated in rhetoric. She is wholly unsentimental about Mobutu, whom she calls brutal, ruthless and greedy, a neighborhood thug, but she also insists that if Mobutu traced a Kurtz-like trajectory from high ideals to febrile corruption, he did not pursue that itinerary alone, or unaided. The story of Congo between Mobutu's rise to power in 1965 and his involuntary departure 32 years later is at once simple and familiar, yet unimaginably complicated, ambiguous and mysterious. On the one hand, it is a tale of a charming, stylish, intelligent, manipulative man who rose from unlikely origins, gained control of his government by unscrupulous means and bled its treasury dry it is a tale that has been told many times, in many settings and with many casts of characters, and it gets no prettier with each retelling. On the other hand, it is a hugely intricate tapestry in which past and present are woven together in patterns that sometimes prove impenetrable a tale involving so many people, organizations and acronyms that sheer bewilderment is the only honest way to respond and a tale upon which it is impossible, in most respects if not all, to pronounce final and confident moral judgment.

The bill has been criticized as a legislative hall of mirrors, with benefits that often look bigger, or smaller, than they really are depending on when they take effect and for how long.

In order to do that, Senators had to push some benefits out to year 11, while starting others quickly, then stopping them after a couple of years.

For example, income-tax rate relief begins immediately, but takes full effect only in 2007 estate-tax repeal, tax relief for married couples and the doubling of the child credit all become fully effective in 2011.

Mr. Bastiaens, a 54-year-old Belgian citizen, was arrested Saturday while sunbathing in his backyard in Winchester, Mass., a Boston suburb, said Timothy Bane, chief deputy U.S. Marshal in Boston. L&H, a once highflying maker of speech-recognition and language software, has crumbled in the past year amid allegations of accounting fraud. Internal investigations have concluded that nearly half the reported revenue from 1998 to mid-2000 was fake. The Ieper, Belgium, company is operating under bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Belgium. Its market value, which once approached 10 billion, is almost nothing. L&H co-founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie were arrested in Belgium in April on charges of forgery and stock manipulation, along with a third former company executive, Nico Willaert. Mr. Bastiaens was CEO of L&H from 1996 to August 2000, a period when the company appeared to expand spectacularly through acquisitions and internal growth.

The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects. Both companies also reaped tremendous rewards by making initial public offerings during the 2000 biotech stock-market boom -- and both have also seen their stock prices plummet since then. Sequenom, of San Diego, makes systems for sifting through genetic data in order to pinpoint meaningful genetic differences that might be linked to disease. Gemini, of Cambridge, England, has focused on amassing large databases of genetic data from twins, disease-affected families and participants in drug trials. The two companies struck a research partnership last June, one that has already produced tentative gene candidates linked to heart disease. Under the terms of the agreement, Gemini shareholders will receive 0.2 share of Sequenom in exchange for each share of Gemini stock. Sequenom shares dropped 11 on news of the deal, and as of 4 p.m. traded at 15.75, down 1.93, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Creditors of the company formerly known as Mortgage.com Inc., which was taken public during the IPO boom, accused the Wall Street firm, a unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group, of breaching its underwriting contract by obtaining kickbacks in the form of unusually large trading commissions from investors seeking IPO allocations. The suit by MDCM Holdings Inc. -- the entity that survived after Mortgage.com sold its name and Web site address last year for 1.8 million to a U.S. unit of ABN Amro Holding NV -- is a rare effort by a company claiming it was shortchanged in the IPO allocation process, securities lawyers say. Before ceasing operations, the suit says, MDCM was a provider of online-mortgage services. The case marks a twist in the current controversy surrounding the way Wall Street allocates IPO shares. Since December, individuals have filed more than 125 suits against major securities firms, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by seeking, among other things, oversized commission payments from investors who received IPOs, according to lawyers tracking the suits. But the MDCM suit stands out because it represents a corporate client of a Wall Street firm alleging IPO impropriety. Legal actions by corporate clients potentially are more problematic for Wall Street firms because such companies could possess more detailed data about who received their IPO shares.";1;0

The government is scheduled Monday to report gross domestic product for the first quarter, and most economists expect a flat figure compared with the previous quarter. But a variety of data suggest that the U.S. slowdown is taking its toll on Japan, and that GDP could shrink in the current and third quarters, throwing Japan back into a full-fledged recession. Among the negative signs The index of leading economic indicators has been below 50 for three months in a row, often a harbinger of recession. Industrial production fell 1.7 in April from March. Yesterday, a Ministry of Finance survey of corporate investment suggested slower-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, corporate profits were flat in the latest quarter, after growth of 31.9 in the preceding quarter. It is only a question of timing . . . and not direction -- the economy is heading into recession, wrote Richard Jerram, economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, in a report to clients. Mr. Koizumi says further structural reform, such as clearing up bad loans at banks and eliminating wasteful government spending, will help the economy grow over the medium term. In the short term, however, economists agree that reform will likely damage the economy by increasing unemployment and bankruptcies. Should the economy slow sharply over the next few months, Mr. Koizumi would face increasing pressure to scale back his reform plans, among them his promise to restrain government debt.";1;0

They're looking for the diversification an index fund offers.

Because of the devastation in the technology market, mutual fund investors are coming back to some of the traditional, broad-based, old-economy funds, Bjorgen said. The biggest beneficiary of the shift has been Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. provider of index funds.

But many of those numbers are at best suspect, and at worst part of a game that makes it easier for both parties to do what they want for short-term political reasons, while ignoring problems that are being sown for the long run. Why this gloomy analysis now Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars. Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests. Third, both parties in Congress already are showing in real life why such plans are at risk.

John T. Dillon, International Paper Co.'s chief executive and the new head of the Business Roundtable, pleaded his case at a private meeting with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill yesterday. The dollar's strength against the yen and euro, he said, makes it too hard for U.S. companies to compete with imports and to penetrate foreign markets. There's no question that orders for our products have been off for about a year, and foreign companies are taking an increasing share of the U.S. market, Mr. Dillon said after the meeting with Mr. O'Neill. It's not that their factories are any more efficient than our factories, but they do have a pretty sizable advantage because of the dollar's relationship with other currencies. During the past two weeks, the dollar has surged to 15-year highs both against the British pound -- down to 1.3981 in late New York trading yesterday from 1.4007 a day earlier -- and against a basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners.

But instead, he has been forced to reduce the 395,000 asking price three times -- lowering it by 5,000 on each occasion. The market, says Mr. Mauk, just isn't there. Despite a slowing economy, the U.S. housing market has held strong and is widely credited with having helped to stave off a recession. But in a handful of cities across the country, cracks are starting to appear in the housing market's once-solid foundation.

Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no great nation in history that went off the gold standard and remained great. Since Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem dollars held by foreign governments for gold, we have put that thesis to the test. For the first time in human history, not a single major currency in the world was linked to a commodity. Economist Milton Friedman called the situation unprecedented and said it is not a long-term viable alternative. The world, he said, needs a long-term anchor of some kind. In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. In creating a world monetary system of floating fiat currencies with the stroke of a pen, President Nixon touched off world-wide inflation that lasted through the '70s and early '80s. Yet America recovered to preside over the demise of world communism, and overcame the rising inflation and unemployment of stagflation to enjoy an unparalleled 18-year economic expansion. Today, the U.S. is at the pinnacle of its power and enjoying its greatest prosperity ever. Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong I don't think so.

Analogies to the economics of office buildings are evident, Greenspan said. Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants. A copy of the text was released in Washington. California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a worrisome situation for Californians, certainly, Greenspan said. And because the state comprises one-eighth of our national economy, it should be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date. Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment. As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices of the things they sell, he said.";0;1

Now, slipping energy costs are brightening prospects for longer maturities, which are the most susceptible to inflation concerns. European Government Bonds may be the chief beneficiary of this shift. The specter of rising inflation fueled by higher energy prices loomed in mid-May, when gasoline futures spiked and crude oil was trading near 29 per barrel. But that worry is now off the agenda, says Mike Ryan, chief fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber in New York. Global bond markets are not overly concerned right now about inflation, he says. Against this backdrop, global inflation concerns have been exaggerated, and inflation should fall in many areas of the world by next year in delayed response to slower growth and declining factory-utilization rates, Deutsche Bank strategists expect.

In the euro zone, for instance, inflation is expected to fall to 1.8 in 2002 from 2.7 this year, Deutsche Bank estimates.

The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5 and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs. The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates. But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a bias adjustment factor that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires. The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998. Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months.

Some politicians even argue that this sum is insufficient, that a surplus in excess of 190 billion -- 9 of federal revenue -- is needed. One senator, Kent Conrad D., N.D., took to the Senate floor to announce that risking a surplus of a mere 160 billion, the second largest in American history, was an indication that we were driving right into the fiscal ditch. Sen. Fritz Hollings D., S.C. introduced legislation to repeal the first year of the recently enacted tax cut, arguing that the foregone revenue was needed for other purposes in Washington. By contrast, 38 years ago, President Kennedy proposed a tax cut twice as big a share of gross domestic product as the one just passed. The government was running a budget deficit of 1.3 of GDP at the time, not a huge surplus as today. Saying, in his 1963 State of the Union address, that enacting the tax cut overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress, Kennedy argued that the tax cut will increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises . . . encourage the initiative and risk taking on which our free system depends, induce more investments, production, and capacity use . . . and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for additional effort. Today, by contrast, with a surplus of 1.5 of GDP, Democratic senators warn of driving into a fiscal ditch and seek to recapture the 600 tax-cut checks that American families are about to receive. It is hard to imagine a more extraordinary turn of political perspective.";1;0

In looming congressional debates about fast track negotiating authority, the Bush administration and Congress confront powerful demands from workers, trade unionists and a wider public for rules protecting human rights and labor rights, not just corporate investments, in trade agreements. That's protectionism is a stock reply of government officials, international economists, multinational executives and many pundits trying to make a labor rights-trade link go away. Instead of engaging critics on the merits, their one-dimensional argument goes like this 1 Expanded trade spurs investment, growth and wealth creation in developing countries 2 after they can afford it, developing countries and companies operating in them will stop violating workers' rights and share the wealth. The first proposition is plausible, leaving aside debates about long-term vs. speculative investment and sustainable vs. destructive growth. But the conclusion does not follow. After wealth has been created, respecting workers' rights and paying them fairly is still a choice, one that doesn't always depend on economics. Instead, choosing justice for workers is driven by organizing, bargaining and political action, increasingly on an international scale. In Sri Lanka a few weeks ago, I met dozens of young women from factories in that country's fast-growing free trade zones who explained that the government's Board of Investment sets up company- controlled worker councils and gets rid of workers who try to form real unions.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that productivity -- which measures output per hour worked -- grew at an unexpectedly strong 2.5 percent rate in the second quarter, compared with a revised 0.1 percent rate in the previous quarter. In large part, the improved efficiency in the April-June period resulted from companies' laying off workers and cutting work hours to bring labor costs into line with sluggish demand for their goods. But companies were able to increase overall national production slightly even with reduced workforces -- and the higher productivity figure didn't fit the usual pattern for recessions and slowdowns, when productivity typically begins to fall. Furthermore, revised figures for 1998 through 2000 showed that productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent during that period. That is a bit lower than the 3.2 percent annual rate originally estimated, but it is still well above the pace recorded during most of the 1970s, '80s and early '90s. And it is robust enough to ease the concerns, voiced by some new-economy skeptics, that the productivity gains of recent years were illusory.

A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections. Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt.

The thought was, let's keep our powder dry a little longer, says Mr. Gallagher. The next few months are going to be rugged. The nation's economy, already stalling prior to Sept. 11, is heading into recession. The consensus of forecasters surveyed Wednesday by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is that the recession will last through the end of this year. What happens then is in dispute.

While that may seem obvious after the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst weekly percentage loss in 61 years, of 14.25 and its worst-ever weekly point loss, 1,369.70 points, it wasn't something that many investors probably spent enough time thinking about during the bull market run of the 1990s. Now, with the Bush administration warning of a lengthy battle against terrorism, investors say that the risks associated with owning stocks -- as opposed to safer securities with more predictable returns, such as bonds -- are poised to rise. This is what analysts call a risk premium as it gets higher, investors require a greater return from stocks compared to bonds.

The president often appears more serious, more stern and more conscious of the image he projects, here and abroad, according to lawmakers and aides who have spent time with him. A unilateralist for much of his first eight months in office, he has found himself relying on numerous foreign leaders, phoning them from the Oval Office in the morning, and from his residence after sundown. Remarkably, for a man who came to office unschooled in foreign affairs and with scant experience abroad, Mr. Bush has embraced the foreign-policy imperative and, aides say, shows far less interest in the domestic matters that had preoccupied him up to now. He has winnowed his agenda to bipartisan-only legislation. In the conduct of domestic and international affairs, he has formed the kind of alliance with Democrats in Congress that he talked about in his 2000 campaign, but hadn't forged in office.

"842616789";"2001-10-02";"Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending. The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon -- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing. Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils losses in the time value of money a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear. If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages.";1;0

Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some economists expected oil prices to rise on fears that a war in the Middle East would disrupt the supply of oil. Instead, prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have all fallen as concerns have grown that a possible global recession could drastically cut demand for energy.

Following two half- point cuts in the past month, the federal funds rate now stands at 2.5 percent, or slightly less than the inflation rate, and there is no reason to think the Fed is finished slashing. Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. market strategist at Lehman Brothers, figures we could get down to 1.5 percent to 2 percent short-term rates by sometime next year, the lowest level since the late 1950s. At the same time, Congress is brewing up an incentive package of tax cuts and spending programs that should add further fuel to the economic fire. Applegate notes that in every recession since 1950, the market rebounded before the economy did, driven by the combined effects of rate cuts, falling inflation and, in some cases, tax cuts. The key variable for the stock market is how much stimulus does the market think is in the pipeline, he said. And the truth is there's a lot, with more to come.";0;1

The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index rose to 83.4 in mid-October from 81.8 at the end of September and well above the low of 72 recorded in one week late in September. The latest number was close to the 83.6 reading in mid-September. The university's survey showed that consumers are feeling more optimistic about the future, with the index for consumer expectations rising to 77.9 in mid-October from 73.5 at the end of September and 77.2 in mid-September. The latest economic numbers, meanwhile, seemed to tell less about where the country is headed than where it had been after the terrorist attacks. Wholesale prices rose 0.4 in September from August, according to the Labor Department. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales plunged 2.4 last month, which was largely expected because of the terrorist attacks. Everyone was home watching television the week of the 11th, said Bryan Jordan, an economist with Banc One Investment Advisors. If we're looking for a silver lining in these numbers, it's that pipeline pressures continue to be well-behaved, and I think that does signal lower inflation. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee isn't likely to see September's producer prices as a significant factor when it meets next month, Mr. Jordan said. He predicted at least one more round of interest-rate cuts as policy makers continue to try to prod the economy toward recovery.";1;0

A compilation of estimates done nine days after the attacks expects European profits to grow by 14.6 next year. That actually is up slightly from the August consensus The compilation was done by IBES, a financial-research firm.

Mail volume was down 5 percent in September over the same period last year. Revenue in the first three weeks after the attacks was as much as 500 million below forecast. Costs associated with damage to a post office near the World Trade Center are at 63 million and mounting. Postal Service officials express faith that the institution will recover, but others say the government-created monopoly is spending money it can ill-afford to increase security, combat the anthrax threat and ensure safe and timely mail delivery. No one knows how much the fear of anthrax-tainted mail will lead to further declines in volume. It's unprecedented, Postal Rate Commission analyst Robert Cohen said. This was a direct attack using the mail as a weapon. It is making everybody rethink the role of the Postal Service. The rate payer will wind up paying a lot more money for this. What's likely to happen is the debt will keep growing and growing, and, ultimately, it could be up to Congress to bail them out. Even before Sept. 11, the Postal Service was expecting a 1.65 billion deficit for fiscal 2001. It had announced it would seek its third rate hike in less than a year. It had cut 21,000 positions.

Now they're looking at a deficit instead. To begin to ward it off, Gov. Parris Glendening this week ordered more than 200 million in budget cuts, and it's likely there will be more if, as expected, the Sept. 11 attacks accentuate the economic slowdown that was already underway. The same pattern is evident in Virginia, though there, officials struggling to protect the governor's irresponsible car tax repeal have been slower to respond. The state was giddily projecting 7.5 percent revenue growth for the fiscal year. In fact, in the first quarter of the year, from July through September, revenue collections were down 2.4 percent from the year before, and that too was mainly before the September attacks. The District is in a similar bind. The attack on the Pentagon, the temporary closing of Reagan National Airport and the drop-off in tourism have delivered sharp blows to the city's economy. As D.C. chief financial officer Natwar Gandhi announced yesterday, it seems possible that local sources of revenue could be reduced by as much as 90 million to 100 million in fiscal 2002 compared with the fiscal 2002 budget estimate. And there's a good chance the current revenue estimate for fiscal 2003 will also need to be reduced. The District's difficulties are compounded by its debt burden, the second highest in the nation among cities. That heavy load limits the city's borrowing capability. And the city's problem is more basic a long-term structural imbalance between its revenue base and required expenditures, brought on by restrictions on the city's taxing authority. Five years of economic good times masked that imbalance, as Mr. Gandhi said yesterday. With the economy souring, the imbalance will become glaringly apparent, he said. All over the country, state and local governments are having to cut back, or else raise taxes. They have no choice their revenues are down and they are bound by law or tradition to balance their budgets. But the squeeze occurs at precisely the wrong time. By cutting back, the states amplify the downturn that afflicts them, and the amplification is the greater because the cuts come just as more people are qualifying for unemployment benefits, welfare and Medicaid spending goes down when it ought to be going up. This time around, state and local officials, particularly in such areas as this, face sharply increased security costs as well.";0;1

It looked like things were bottoming out and starting to look a little bit bitter, said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Obviously, September has changed that. The drop in the leading index in September is the largest one-month decline since January 1996, said Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board. Without the aggressive expansionary policy being adopted by the Federal Reserve, this drop would have been much deeper, he said. Six out of the 10 indicators fell in September.

Others said the outlook remains uncertain.

With U.S. gas producers finding it tough to boost output, Americans are looking north to help satisfy demand. Canada supplies about 16 of the natural-gas consumed by its southern neighbor, up from 11 in 1995. But with its own productive capacity peaking, Canada isn't likely to provide a sustained fix for U.S. gas consumers, specialists here caution. That could lead to a supply crunch when a U.S. economic recovery takes hold. According to most analysts, U.S. demand for natural gas probably will expand steadily in the long term, due mainly to the fuel's increasing use in electricity generation, while domestic supply stays flat. Even in its latest short-term forecast for natural-gas demand -- revised to reflect economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic demand rebounding by 3.9 in 2002 after falling 2 this year. To address anticipated demand growth, U.S. energy companies have been snapping up natural-gas companies and assets in Canada, made cheaper by low natural-gas prices and the strong U.S. dollar.

MetLife has established 83 million in reserves, largely to cover that type of disability claim, though it won't give a specific breakdown. Although the life-insurance industry has taken a relatively light hit from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it nonetheless has been affected by the strikes and their aftermath. Analysts estimate life-insurance companies will have losses of between 3 billion and 6 billion related to Sept. 11, much smaller than the estimated 40 billion to 70 billion in insured losses expected to be paid by property-casualty insurers. Of course, the biggest cost for the industry will be paying life-insurance claims for people killed in the attacks. But the industry is also bracing for an increase in disability claims, and not just from workers hurt in downtown Manhattan.

Analysts now warn that if the political stalemate continues past Thanksgiving, the lack of a fiscal stimulus package would deepen the recession and render the eventual recovery less robust while sending stock prices tumbling again on Wall Street. If we're going to limit the severity of a recession, we need to quickly nip this in the bud, said Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.

The economists generally expect the Fed to lower its target to 1.5 percent, probably in two quarter-point steps at meetings scheduled for mid-December and late January. The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the attacks seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity, the members of the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded, the minutes said. Looking ahead, the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty, notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term, they said. The minutes are a summary of the officials' discussions, not a transcript, and the word recession does not appear in the minutes.

Now comes the U.S. Census Bureau with its data on family income and poverty for 2000, thereby permitting informed judgments about whether welfare reform is driving poor families into the Grate Society. For the seventh year in a row, poverty was down. Further, black and Hispanic households had their lowest poverty rates ever, and the overall child poverty rate was lower than in any year since 1976. Similarly, black and Hispanic households both set records for all-time high incomes. How is the nation making such remarkable progress against poverty and low income The Census Bureau report shows that an important part of the answer is that welfare reform has led to huge increases in work and earnings by single mothers and a revolution in how government helps the poor. No longer does government help the poor primarily by giving them welfare benefits. The new approach is to encourage, cajole and, if necessary, force poor and able-bodied parents to take jobs. Then, once they are employed, government provides help through a system of work supports that includes cash earnings subsidies, primarily through the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC, medical insurance, food subsidies, child care and housing. The Census Bureau data show how this new approach works. Consider the group of about 2 million families headed by mothers with incomes under 13,000. In 1993 this group earned on average only 1,400 and had welfare benefits primarily cash and food stamps of 4,400 all figures are adjusted for inflation. By 2000, their earnings had increased by 130 percent, to 3,100, and their welfare benefits had declined by a quarter to 3,300. In addition, they enjoyed a 300 percent increase in EITC income. The net effect was that total income for these mothers and children rose by a quarter, to 8,600. Now consider the group of 2 million mothers with incomes between 13,000 and 21,000, a group that includes many mothers leaving welfare. Earnings increased from 4,900 in 1993 to 11,700 in 2000.

Some in Congress have argued that now is not the time to take up legislation that has encountered such fierce protectionist opposition in recent years. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the current economic slowdown, it is all the more important that Congress move quickly to approve this vital measure. This bipartisan action would inspire confidence in global capital markets. It would allow America to be seen as continuing to lead the open trade and globalization that has been so vital to the prosperity of both developed and developing countries. And it would send a powerful message that the president and Congress speak with one voice, and are committed to advancing freer trade as part of the war on terror. Indeed, approval of TPA would signal that the U.S. is not only seeking a military coalition, but an economic one. The benefits of trade hardly need illuminating. America's exports accounted for approximately one-third of our extraordinary economic growth over the past decade, and exports now support over 12 million American jobs nearly three million more than a decade ago. Jobs supported by exports typically pay 13 to 18 more than comparable employment. Trade brings real economic benefits to the U.S. The North American Free Trade Agreement, and the completion of the previous round of trade negotiations the Uruguay Round, now generate annual income gains of 1,300 to 2,000 for the average American family of four. Trade is also fundamental to economic growth in the developing world. A recent World Bank study shows that nations open to trade grow 3.5 times faster than nations closed to trade. The recent experience of countries such as South Korea, China and Chile underscore that trade is a pathway to prosperity. Trade is a two-way street, and imports also benefit the U.S. They provide consumers with more choices and lower prices on a wide variety of goods. Imports also force our industries to constantly improve and innovate in order to remain competitive with foreign exporters.";1;0

Nearly a half million people joined the ranks of the unemployed in November, bringing the total to 8.2 million, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The increase from 5.4 percent in October was evidence of the continued sharp deterioration of the job market since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the economy slowed over the past year, unemployment had been rising slowly, from a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in October 2000, before shooting up in the past two months, when 1.1 million more people lost their jobs. The layoffs continued even as signs mounted that the recession that began last spring may be close to running its course, according to several forecasters, some of whom have begun predicting that the economy may start growing again early next year. Even if the recession does end soon, many forecasters expect the unemployment rate to continue rising for several months, reaching 6.5 percent or so next year before it begins to come down.

The meltdown in the travel and tourism business has claimed thousands of their jobs.

"830985458";"2001-12-11";"Waiting for Congress to pass the much-needed economic stimulus bill is beginning to look like waiting for Godot. Fortunately for the U.S. economy, two large private industries -- automobiles and homebuilding -- have stepped up to provide the stimulus that the government has thus far failed to deliver. There is a great irony here. A clear function of government -- combating recessions -- is being performed by the private sector. But there's actually a double irony, for government policies have been instrumental in enabling each of these industries to accomplish what it has. The auto industry's contribution has been more spectacular but will be less durable. Right after the terrorist attacks, industry executives saw some pretty bad-looking handwriting on the wall and reacted quickly -- in what they perceived to be their companies' best interest. They offered buyers 0 percent financing, a head-turning discount that filled the nation's showrooms and produced record sales just when the economy most needed the additional spending. Thank you, Detroit. I don't pretend to know whether 0 percent financing made good business sense for GM, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler. After all, it's costly -- the auto finance companies that lend you money at no interest do not get their funds for free. But it did succeed in driving auto sales to record highs while other categories of consumer spending were slumping, which is quite a feat. The 0 percent financing programs thus amounted to a kind of privatized stimulus policy -- wonderfully timed, well-targeted and effective. Would that Congress had done so well. But notice that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate cuts made it all possible. If short-term interest rates were as high today as they were in January, free auto loans would probably have been too expensive for Detroit. I doubt that people at the Fed were thinking about 0 percent financing when they started cutting interest rates back in January. But monetary policy sometimes works in unexpected ways. The story in housing may be less dramatic, but it is much longer lasting. As the economy weakened before the terrorist attacks, observers marveled at how well the housing sector was holding up. This industry acted as a pillar of strength supporting the U.S. economy in at least two ways. First, homes continued to be built in large numbers even while much of the rest of the economy slipped. Second, millions of American households obtained immediate cash by refinancing their mortgages at lower rates they then spent some of this money on consumer goods.";0;1

Shrewd market watchers take this as the surest sign that a bull market is in the throes of death, even before the decline becomes visible. Maury Klein's Rainbow's End recounts the national zaniness that coincided with the decision by millions of Americans to step into the stock market for the first time in the mid- and late 1920s. Many argued that the country's economy had entered a new era of prosperity, as President Calvin Coolidge expressed it. Who, after all, could argue with what Frederick Lewis Allen later called a ceaseless flow of new delights the automobile, the telephone, movies, radios, refrigerators, record players In corporate boardrooms, something called scientific management was taking hold to replace the apparently unscientific management of days gone by, when managers simply did what they thought would make money. For the first time in the 1920s, Wall Street firms marketed stocks to the public en masse. The number of investment trusts, the precursors to today's mutual funds, increased sixfold, with more attention paid to the big names running the funds than to the funds' potential risks and benefits. The number of Americans owning stocks shot from about 500,000 to 15 million. On Oct. 15, 1929, Yale professor Irving Fisher declared infamously, in hindsight that stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. Nine days later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began a long and steep plunge that stripped the market of 40 percent of its value in three weeks and continued, with a few interruptions, into 1932. All I lost was two hundred and forty thousand dollars, Groucho Marx said later. I would have lost more but that was all the money I had. The apparent parallels between the period before the crash of 1929 the New Era and the period that led to the market collapse of 2000 and early 2001 the New Economy are obvious and have been noted ad nauseum anecdotally in the financial press for two years. Klein, a historian of business and finance, evidently thought it beyond his mission to use the opportunity to explore the similarities, which would have made the book more pointed and useful as a vivid reminder of the ever-present risks intrinsic to equities, which are casually ignored as professionals strive to keep alive the mythology that however bleak the moment, everything will be fine if investors just hold on long enough. One wonders how many investors are aware that after 1929, the Dow didn't regain its pre-crash level until 1954. Twenty-five years is a lot of holding on. Klein's book is not the best place to absorb the market's history. It's painfully slow. It advances no particularly new angles or theories. In its lack of analysis, it doesn't demonstrate why the crash is a pivotal moment in American history fit for inclusion in the Oxford University Press's series of the same name. The author could not resist the common tendency to see every event as either causal or emblematic of the main event of the '29 crash. Klein suggests, for example, that the fad of flagpole sitting and the craze for flying in the '20s were somehow symbolic of the idea that the market could defy gravity. He is equally unconvincing in his efforts to connect everyone from Babe Ruth to evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to a mood of escapism somehow connected with the stock market.";0;1

It was the first time Flad had ever been laid off. He got another surprise when District officials directed him to the AFL-CIO union headquarters, two blocks from the White House, to file his claim for unemployment benefits. When they told me to go to the AFL building, I thought that must be a mistake, Flad said in an interview last month, as he filled out the paperwork in a large room normally used as the union officials' lunchroom. Flad said that it was his first contact in his professional life with a union and that previously he had viewed unions with disdain. Now, he is rethinking that attitude, he said. A lot of white-collar jobs are turning into electronic sweatshops, said Flad, who lives in Rockville. Sooner or later, I think more of them will turn to unions. The AFL cafeteria-turned-unemployment center is one example of many around the country where unions have begun offering services to members and to other needy workers who lost their jobs after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 devastated an already troubled hospitality industry. These services help unions as they struggle to maintain links to workers who might otherwise leave the fold. In Los Angeles, the County Federation of Labor is dispensing 3 million in aid to unemployed hotel and airport workers to help them keep their health insurance current and pay utility bills.";0;1

The big reason buyers are turning down the specialized coverage, whose value was illustrated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is it has become simply too expensive, in many cases costing more than a company's basic commercial coverage. There is terrorism coverage available, but it's at outrageous prices, said Bob Spadaccia, senior vice president for the Northeast at USI Insurance Services Corp., a San Francisco insurance broker. Real-estate companies and any other entities that are required, either by law or, in some cases, by lenders, to buy the terrorism coverage are choking on the numbers, he said. Prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, which are estimated to be costing the insurance industry at least 40 billion, such terrorism coverage was included as part of a standard policy. Now, terrorism coverage is being stripped out of the policies offered to most large businesses and owners of properties viewed by insurance companies as the likeliest targets, including tall office buildings, sports stadiums and shopping malls. These businesses are being offered the chance to buy back the coverage, but only at the steep prices. USI estimates only about one in 10 such clients is opting to buy back the coverage. Smaller, lower-profile businesses are less affected by the insurance industry's retrenchment. They are generally still able to get terrorism coverage as part of a basic package, albeit at higher prices than they paid last year, brokers said.";1;0

The settlement calls for the higher rates to take effect at least three months earlier than the October implementation the Postal Service originally projected, giving the agency a much-needed revenue infusion. The agency reported a 1.7 billion loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2001, and it has predicted a similar result for the current fiscal year.

The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse. To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits as far as the eye could see thereafter. Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election. Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, stayed the course. Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined. The nation shook off the strange combination of slow growth and inflation that characterized the Carter years and grew at a healthy rate through the rest of the 1980s. The stock market, recognizing that a new and different economic policy had taken hold in Washington, surged to unprecedented levels.";1;0

I believe recovery will occur around mid-2002 -- a few months later than the median forecast predicts, Anthony Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech. He was one of five Fed officials to speak so far this week. Their comments, while more upbeat than they have been for months, suggest they are less impressed with the run of positive economic reports, ranging from capital-goods orders to home sales, than private forecasters and investors. Mr. Santomero, for example, said it may take longer than expected for companies to rebuild inventories, something optimistic analysts are counting on to generate higher production and an imminent recovery. He said consumer spending, though resilient so far, could retrench if big layoffs persist. A Wall Street Journal poll of 54 forecasters found that two-thirds expect the economy to grow in the current quarter, and almost all expect growth in the next quarter. But Fed officials see more risks. Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said in a speech that while the consensus forecast is the most probable outcome . . . I think there's a good chance that the economy may be at least a little softer than the consensus over the next year or so. He cited the risk that continued weak profits will hold back business investment. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Jack Guynn said the economy would probably contract for another quarter or two.

But while many industries across the country are still hurting from the recession, the economists think real estate may be leading the way back up. Home prices nationally will once again climb over the coming year, by an average of 2.8. In fact, out of the 20 cities tracked, only two won't see prices rise, the forecasters say. Still, the upswing will be remarkably varied across the country, with some cities, such as San Diego, barely squeaking ahead prices are expected to go up by just 0.8 there, while others, like Washington, D.C., should boast a robust jump of more than 7. And though prices usually go up in the spring, Case Shiller Weiss predicts that in most places they won't climb until the second half of the year.

Patrick and Sharon Brem discovered that for themselves when they recently tried to sell their loft in downtown San Francisco. That market has been one of the hardest hit in recent months and the economists say prices will drop by an additional 5.7 this year, making it the only city in the survey where they'll actually fall.

The peso lost about 40 of its value Friday, the first day of trading since the government last week replaced Argentina's one-to-one peg with the dollar with a dual exchange-rate system. Under the new system, trade and some financial transactions will be covered by a fixed exchange rate of 1.40 pesos to the dollar, while Argentines seeking to buy or sell dollars for other transactions will have to do so on the open market where the peso will float freely. In Friday's trading, the peso closed around 1.70 pesos to the dollar, but the bulk of activity was at the small exchange houses that had languished during the past decade when the dollar and peso were used side by side. Banks received rules from Argentina's central bank on how the new foreign-exchange market would function about 12 hours before markets opened, and opted to sit out the session. Meanwhile, the financial system has already been struggling to cope with operational complications resulting from the restrictions on cash withdrawals imposed at the start of December and limits on account movements imposed subsequently. Demand for dollars, so far, has been muted because people are short of cash in pesos for buying groceries and paying routine bills. Some economists are forecasting the peso will slump this week to 1.8-2.0 to the dollar as banks become more active in the foreign-exchange market and the government considers reversing recent decisions to slowly lift the bank limits. Leaving the limits on too long is likely to exacerbate a recession already in its fourth year and spark greater social unrest suddenly scrapping them could cause the banking sector to collapse. Late Thursday night, residents of several middle-class neighborhoods took to the streets again to protest further banking restrictions introduced by the administration of President Eduardo Duhalde.

In a new ad campaign to promote the games, for example, NBC has inserted several prominent mentions of the rerelease of the 1982 movie E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial from Vivendi Universal SA's Universal Studios. For viewers, the result is in effect two ads in one, and they see billboards that don't really exist. The ad campaign, which is aimed at drawing young viewers, was created by the network's internal agency. It revolves around a chase scene involving two Olympians, the snowboarder Chris Klug and Cammi Granato, a hockey player who helped the U.S. team win the gold medal at the 1998 games. In the spots, Mr. Klug zooms through a mountain of fresh powder as police and state troopers chase him for speeding.

Mr. Fraga met with Argentine Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov to discuss how Brazil managed a significant devaluation of the Brazilian real, which boosted exports, while keeping inflation to single-digit rates. The talks were punctuated by the sound of demonstrators beating drums, chanting and blocking traffic outside government ministries in this bankrupt capital city. Meanwhile, in the far north, gangs of the unemployed broke windows at utility and bank offices. Argentina, after linking its currency 1-1 to the U.S. dollar for a decade, last week devalued the peso by 29 to an official rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar. Since then, the peso has dropped even more on a parallel free market. It closed at 1.85 to the dollar yesterday, down from 1.70 Monday. In the meantime, the new government of President Eduardo Duhalde is scurrying to put together an economic plan that will allow angry Argentines to access bank accounts that have been partially frozen for the past six weeks. Yesterday, Mr. Fraga discussed Brazil's experience in 1999 moving from a fixed to a floating exchange rate and Brazil's experience with inflation targeting, said Thais Heredia, a spokeswoman for Brazil's central bank.

Even those Treasury-market strategists who had been consistently warning about an impending meltdown of consumer spending are changing their tune in light of stronger economic reports in the past month. If there was going to be a day of reckoning for the consumer, I would have thought it would have happened by now, said Mary Ann Hurley, senior Treasurys trader in Seattle for brokerage D.A. Davidson. Consumers account for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Ms. Hurley sees selective opportunities in riskier corporate bonds whose valuations benefit as consumer spending gears up.";1;0

Limited, based in Columbus, Ohio, offered part of Intimate Brands, parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, to the public in 1995 in a move designed to highlight the value of the businesses. At the time, Intimate Brands accounted for 70 of Limited's operating income but less than 60 of the company's stock-market valuation. Today, the two measures are more in line. Limited gets more than 90 of its operating income from Intimate Brands and about 95 of its market capitalization. The most significant factor in the Board's decision to take this action is the belief that a recombination of the businesses at this point will allow us to achieve greater growth, Leslie Wexner, chief executive of both companies, said in a statement. This clearer, simpler structure will allow us to fully develop the potential of our best brands across merchandise categories and distribution channels. Under terms of the proposal, Limited is offering 1.046 Limited shares for each Class A share of Intimate Brands. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Limited were down 70 cents at 17.75, while Intimate Brands slipped 40 cents to 17.50.

To get to the market quickly, ImClone tried a high-risk strategy to seek regulatory approval with one small, unusually designed clinical trial. But the Food and Drug Administration in December refused to review its application. The resulting mess -- a rash of shareholder lawsuits, embarrassing publicity, and investigations by Congress and regulators -- has been a nightmare for ImClone and its officers and directors. But ImClone's stumble may have created an unexpected opportunity for AstraZeneca PLC and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the multibillion-dollar market for this new class of cancer drugs. AstraZeneca may now lead the pack On the very day ImClone announced the FDA's decision, Dec. 28, AstraZeneca said it had completed its application with the agency for its drug. Whoever is on the market first will dominate for a long period of time, says oncologist Eric Rowinsky, director of clinical research at the Institute for Drug Development in San Antonio, where he has run clinical trials on five rival drugs to ImClone's drug, Erbitux. Eagerly anticipated by oncologists and patients, ImClone's treatment was expected to be the first of a new class of drugs that tries to stop cancer from spreading by interfering with the chemical signals -- most notably the activation of substances on the outside of cells called epidermal growth factor receptors -- that seem to tell cells to proliferate. Most solid-tumor cancers -- colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and head-and-neck -- appear to grow using the chemical signaling the medicines aim to block. Although each of the new drugs might be approved initially for different types of tumors, they are expected to compete because oncologists routinely use drugs on many types of cancers besides the approved ones.";1;0

They have appeared suddenly, like sinkholes in tapped-out oil fields 12.5 billion in California, 1.4 billion in Michigan, 533 million in Kentucky. These shortfalls are small by federal standards. But unlike the government in Washington, state governments must balance their budgets every year Virtually all are forbidden, by law or constitution, from running deficits. As a result, 40 states must close a collective 40 billion in deficits for fiscal 2002, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. But this being an election year, the story doesn't end there. From Hartford to Sacramento, these gaps are generating significant political tension. Virtually every state chief executive has ruled out the most potent revenue-raising weapon in his or her arsenal income tax increases. And that's a mistake. Governors are turning their backs on the most ready source of revenues -- as well as the fairest and most painless way of raising funds. It wasn't always this way. During the last recession, in the early 1990s, governors and big city mayors faced much the same challenge. Many of them, Democrats and Republicans alike, took what seemed to be the easy route. They simply cut spending and pushed through income tax hikes. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton pursued essentially the same strategy, boosting marginal income tax rates on the highest-earning Americans. But while the income tax increases of a decade ago proved to be solid fiscal successes, they were abject political failures. And as a result, today's governors treat income tax increases the way members of the Texas congressional delegation treat Enron. They shudder even to mention the powerful force that until recently provided them with immense benefits even though, from a fiscal perspective, it makes the most sense to tax the richest vein of revenues. Never mind the hoary debate over regressive sales taxes and progressive taxes on income. Raising taxes on income simply doesn't enter the vocabulary of today's governors, regardless of their party. Instead, today's fiscally challenged governors are earnestly pledging to cut spending, commandeering funds from the tobacco settlement, and placing big bets on two fiscal long-shots a swift economic recovery and increased federal aid. Those who are raising revenues are embracing less politically painful -- and likely less effective -- taxes on cigarettes, telephones, sales and services.";0;1

If income inequality has spawned terrorist movements, the thinking goes, then rich countries should shell out more to make the world safer. But enormous sums of aid for development have already been wasted over past decades. And different countries have different needs Afghanistan's request for peacekeeping forces is a far cry from Argentina's entreaty for a financial bailout. Easy as it might be to succumb to the cheap grace of writing checks, the Bush administration is proposing a more thoughtful approach to foreign aid. Its goals, to emphasize quality over quantity and to focus on measurable results, will no doubt antagonize the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, who prefer to help the world by soliciting more funds for their own budgets. Under the Bush plan, recipient nations will be asked to assume greater responsibility for their own economic decisions. Call it the tough love approach to global development. One of the first steps is recognizing that economic growth must begin in the soil of basic security and the rule of law. In countries besieged by war and political instability, few have the luxury of focusing on improving their own prospects. I receive daily delegations from all over Afghanistan, notes Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai. They all ask for security and peace more than education, health and development. Financial assistance that fights crime and promotes a functioning legal system is money well spent. But it can only succeed where a nation is committed to transparency and good governance. Helping improve nations' productivity is another area where foreign assistance can help. Access to health care and education allows individuals to become contributors to the global economy rather than be left behind or remain perpetual burdens. Enrolling girls in school can literally double the potential work force. Likewise, money to provide vaccinations against infectious diseases or prevent the spread of AIDS not only relieves human misery, but changes the social and economic dynamics of stricken nations. In South Africa, the AIDS tax the epidemic's cost on business is as high as 10 per year. Still, as nice as it all sounds, humanitarian aid to improve peoples' lives and give them the chance to be productive is an empty victory without opportunities for nations to capture the rewards of upgraded skills and lift themselves out of poverty. And much of that responsibility falls to local governments. No one is indifferent to scenes of desperate people in Argentina being injured or killed in riots caused by money meltdown and financial chaos. But as Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill points out, Argentine officials received some 60 billion in emergency assistance from the IMF and other sources, yet they just didn't reform. It is irresponsible to continue giving money to a government that violates the most basic commitment to its citizens.";1;0

Clearly, stock and bond investors have hedged their bets All the averages are way below their optimistic thresholds. The bankruptcies of Enron, Kmart, Global Crossing and others have cast serious doubt about the sustainability of recovery. And lingering in the background is always the threat of another terrorist attack, Mideast war, or Third World currency collapse. As Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and later chief economist for the World Bank, warned way back in November, this recession might turn out to be the worst in 20 years. As Professor Stiglitz sees it, a deep recession like 1981-82 is the best we can hope for. In that 16-month recession, output fell by 12.3 and unemployment soared to a post-war high of 10.8. By contrast, in the 1990-91 recession, output fell only 2.3 and unemployment peaked at 6.5. That is the kind of short, shallow recession the optimists are hoping for this time around. Despite the spate of warning signs, the optimistic outlook still remains strong. The optimists' case rests not only on the usual array of indicators -- rising consumer confidence, abnormally low inventories, cheap money, and fiscal stimulus -- but also on a wild card few observers have noticed.";1;0

Hugh Martin, ONI's chairman, president and chief executive, said the companies are a perfect match, since Ciena specializes in equipment for long-haul networks while ONI provides gear for metropolitan networks. Mr. Martin said he initiated the deal, partly because ONI's telecommunications-carrier customers had expressed some concern about breadth of product line and customer support from ONI as a stand-alone company. Although Ciena has increased its market share over the past year, the Linthicum, Md., company -- like its competitors -- has been hit hard by plummeting demand for networking gear, as telecommunications carriers rein in spending or struggle to stay in business.

"830984644";"2002-02-26";"President Bush today will propose a revision of the landmark 1996 law that overhauled the welfare system, by increasing work requirements on people who get government assistance, while giving states new subsidies to encourage marriage and continuing a ban on welfare payments to immigrants, administration officials said yesterday. Bush's plan, to be announced at a Washington Catholic church, would increase the percentage of welfare recipients required to have jobs or take part in related activities by 5 percent a year, raising it from 50 percent to 70 percent. The plan would require a 40-hour workweek, instead of 30, with accommodations for parents with infants or other special circumstances. As a concession to governors and congressional Democrats, the plan would let states count 16 hours of education or other job preparation toward the 40 hours of required work. I think work ought to be the core of welfare reform, Bush told a meeting of governors at the White House yesterday. In order to make sure that welfare reform works, that there's flexibility at the states, that there's recognition people need training or drug rehabilitation. But work ought to be the centerpiece of a good welfare law. In highlights of the plan released by the administration last evening, the White House made clear for the first time that it does not intend to restore the ban on welfare benefits for immigrants who entered the country legally after 1996. Those immigrants were one of the main groups that lost benefits under the welfare law six years ago. Democrats are joining welfare rights groups and immigrant advocates in urging that those benefits be restored. A White House document labels its decision on that issue, Safeguarding Against Welfare Dependency Among Non-Citizens.

Here is why these pessimists are utterly mistaken. The doomsters say that pro-market policy reforms, supported by aid donors and especially by the World Bank, have been a failure. But two decades of reform have actually succeeded. Since 1980 the number of people living on less than 1 a day has fallen by about 200 million, even as the world's population has risen by 1.6 billion. That is a stunning achievement given that the ranks of the poor previously had swollen steadily at least since 1820.

The previous 20-year jump in longevity had taken since the Stone Age. The doomsters say that even if some developing countries did well, there's no evidence that aid was the reason. But economists can measure aid's role by analyzing aid levels, growth rates and other variables across countries. The World Bank calculates that 1 billion in extra aid lifts more than 250,000 people above the 1-a-day line. The doomsters say that even if aid has some effect, it's unproductive by the standards of advanced economies.

Union officials at two plants in California -- an airplane development center in Palmdale and a missiles and space facility in Sunnyvale -- have expressed support for the package. The company's final offer was announced yesterday after nearly 36 hours of negotiations with the aid of federal mediators. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at all three of the plants are to vote on the offer Sunday. Earlier this week, about 6,000 of the workers voted to strike on Monday if there was no agreement. Strikes now appear unlikely in California, but Jim Carroll, president of the union's Local 709 in Marietta, said the contract for the Georgia workers contains different language. Among other concerns, Carroll said the proposed contract would let Lockheed Martin outsource work now being done by employees.

The academics sought to document how shopping became the engine of 20th-century urban growth. They contend shopping is now the defining activity of public life. We shop at the airport, we shop at church. The train station is now a mall. McDonald's is also a toy store. Former military bases are being reconditioned as theme parks with shopping malls. We can buy embryos at the hospital. Museums make more money from their shops than from any other single source. And we are happy to treat ourselves to cultured gift wrap. Urbanization is commerce. Few consumers would deny that their lives -- and the local landscape -- have been affected by mall sprawl, Big Box empires, entertainment zones and outlet villages. The real-life mystery is why so many serious architects didn't involve themselves at every step in their creation. Koolhaas, of course, is the Pritzker Prize-winning creator of such high-profile design ventures as the Guggenheim Las Vegas and Prada's SoHo boutique. As an architect and thinker, he has long sought to meld high and low culture. The shopping project met that test Koolhaas turned Harvard's elite into mall rats.

Still, evidence is mounting that a recovery on the Continent is under way. Among the 12 countries that share the euro, GDP, the total value of goods and services, contracted by 0.2 in the fourth quarter from the third, Eurostat reported. Growth was dragged down by corporate retrenchment in the face of slackening global demand. But just as it followed the U.S. in its downturn, Europe appears to be moving upward now as well. Surveys show that Europe's overall economic mood, as measured by the European Economic Sentiment Indicator, is now at its best since September, and inflation is on the whole falling. Spaniards are building. Italians are using more phone services and burning more electricity. The French keep buying.

The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1 and 0.4, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4 to 0.7 next quarter. These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate, the commission said in a statement. There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies.";1;0

Dr. Tobin, who was said to have been among the most influential and creative economists of his time, served on the Council of Economic Advisers in John F. Kennedy's administration. He was a major contributor to theories of investment, consumption, money and banking and economic growth, and he was widely known in academia and business as a leading apostle of the economic thinking of British economist John Maynard Keynes that tax and budget policies can be used effectively to regulate an economy. As a Keynesian economist, Dr. Tobin feuded with monetarists who argue that controlling the supply of money and credit is the best way to regulate an economy. His sharp attacks on Milton Friedman, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics and widely recognized as the dean of monetarists, were particularly well publicized, as were his criticisms in the early 1980s of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Volcker's single-minded effort to curb inflation with tough monetary policy, Dr. Tobin told a congressional subcommittee, was likely to result in damage to the real economy in terms of unemployment, low production, recession, low investment and so on. Economics, Dr. Tobin once told a meeting of the American Economic Association, inevitably blends ideology and science. Describing the portfolio selection theory that helped him win a Nobel Prize, he said it sets forth the principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket because then, if something goes wrong, you lose them all at once. This theory was said to have been influential in the willingness of investors to diversify holdings.

There are those here in Washington who see it as the first of a five-part series on the corruption of the accounting profession. But in the broadest sense, Andersen may be seen as just one tragic character in the boom-and-bust saga of the 1990s -- a victim as much as a protagonist in the unfolding drama of cheap capital, fast fortunes and stock-price addiction. It is the story not just of Andersen and Enron but Global Crossing and MicroStrategy, WorldCom and Qwest, the dot-com bust and the two-year bear market and even the global recession. In Andersen's case, the path toward criminal indictment began on Wall Street, which by the mid-1990s was awash in money looking to be profitably invested A surge in retirement savings of baby boomers a tidal wave of investment capital from overseas investors unimpressed with opportunities at home hordes of cash generated by newly efficient and profitable U.S. corporations. In time, this excess supply drove stock and bond prices through the roof, encouraging companies to rush out with new offerings to soak up the billions of dollars. And with their inflated shares, companies found they had a sought-after currency with which to buy other companies, secure loans, pay back creditors and compensate employees. In time, the stock-fueled demand drove up the price of everything from Park Avenue condos to the wages of hamburger flippers at McDonald's. For Andersen, Wall Street's boom presented both challenge and opportunity. In attracting and retaining key professionals, firms like Andersen compete with investment banks, consulting and law firms and large corporations.

A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing. A striking feature of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business. Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve pricing power in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare service providers without global competition universities that raise tuition hospitals jacking up fees or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15 since mid-2000. But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy. Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming.

Truth turned out to be stranger than fiction. October 2001 will go down in economic history as the month Americans purchased the greatest number of autos -- ever. While that was largely attributed to auto makers' 0 financing offers, it still leaves unanswered why supposedly depressed Americans were plenty willing to visit -- of all places -- car dealerships. Harder to explain still is why the level of retail spending, after falling in September, has been higher in every succeeding month than it was in August. Indeed, even excluding autos, retail sales grew in every month during the past half-year compared with a year ago. All this while the most closely watched of the two main confidence gauges still hasn't topped pre-Sept. 11 heights. Could it be that consumer sentiment isn't so closely tied to spending behavior after all And if so, what does that mean for the U.S. economy now Carl Steidtmann, chief economist of Deloitte Research, jointly owned by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touch and Deloitte Consulting, believes he has an answer. Mr. Steidtmann compared changes in consumer confidence and consumer spending over the past 20 years. His finding There is very little, if any, relationship between confidence and spending. There are a number of possible explanations for the disconnect, but the most important is that spending and confidence are driven by a different set of factors, he says. Specifically, politics, disasters and war drive confidence, Mr. Steidtmann concludes, while cash flow drives spending. The twain may or may not meet. After Sept. 11, consumer sentiment was buffeted by the terrorist attack, the anthrax mailings and fear of a second blow. But at the same time, cash flow was bolstered by lower interest rates, tax rebates, mortgage refinancings and lower energy prices.";1;0

However, the rising cost of energy -- evident in recent weeks to motorists at the gas pump -- so far does not appear large enough to derail the U.S. economic recovery.

By one measure, crude oil prices peaked this year at just under 28 a barrel 10 days ago, driven upward largely by rising tensions in the Middle East, the prospect of growing oil demand because of the U.S. economic rebound and the possibility of disruptions in oil shipments from Venezuela because of political turmoil there.";0;1

Spending on government programs will increase by 22 percent from 1999 to 2003 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the analysis by The Washington Post and vetted by budget experts in both parties. The president's 2003 budget proposals, combined with spending approved in the first year of his administration and the last two years of the Clinton administration, dwarf the spending increase from any four-year period since President Lyndon Johnson fought the Vietnam War while launching a war on poverty. Other periods of substantial increases in domestic spending, including the Nixon and Carter administrations, were accompanied by cuts in military spending. President Ronald Reagan boosted money for the mili- tary while trimming the domestic budget. In the short term, the latest spending hike is one factor helping to pull the nation out of recession. But over the long run, some experts say, most of the spending will be a drag on the economy, heighten the risk of sustained budget deficits and limit the maneuvering room of policymakers when, 10 years from now, the government must help fund the baby boomers' health care and retirement needs. We should be very concerned, said John Cogan, a budget expert at the Hoover Institution who advised the Bush campaign. Clearly, the defense and national security increases are warranted. The failure to offset those increases with reductions should be a source of concern. The wrong thing to do is not confront those choices.";0;1
"842614707";"2002-04-16";"WASHINGTON AP -- U.S. companies, keeping a close eye on the economic recovery, whittled excess stocks of unsold goods in February for the 13th consecutive month. Stockpiles of unsold goods on shelves and back lots dipped by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That pushed the value of inventories down to 1.13 trillion, the lowest level since November 1999. The drop in inventories came even as businesses' sales slid by 0.9, the biggest decline in three months. With inventories getting lean, prospects are raised that factories, which are already slowly boosting production after a sharp cutback, will need to crank it up more in the coming months, economists said. That's something that would help the country as it recovers from a recession. As the economy stages a comeback, companies are working hard to gauge consumers' and businesses' appetite for their products, something that can be especially tricky when the economy is in transition, economists said.";1;0
"842615234";"2002-04-16";"MEMO TO EMPLOYERS Guess who's starting to call the shots again As the economy shows signs of a nascent recovery, some job seekers are taking an increasingly bold -- and sometimes manipulative -- approach to finding work. Disillusioned by the sweeping layoffs and corporate penny-pinching of the past 18 months, they are employing tactics typically reserved for more robust times, such as accepting two job offers at once and then playing one prospective employer off against the other. Some keep searching for jobs after starting a new post and then jump ship when they find something better. Others, meantime, are holding two good positions at one time, a split of loyalties they hope might blunt the blow of future layoffs. After 10 frustrating months of unemployment, Sandra Gesburg accepted a sales representative job in early February at Advanced Toxicology Network, a Memphis, Tenn., laboratory that provides workplace drug testing. But just three weeks later, she was offered a better position and 25 salary increase from Professional Resources Screening Inc., a Concord, Calif., provider of pre-employment screening. Although the company had turned her down for a job once before, that was no matter -- 48-year-old Ms. Gesburg immediately took the post. They made me an offer I couldn't refuse, she says matter-of-factly. Stuart Bogema, Ms. Gesburg's old boss and ATN's chief executive, says he wasn't too happy with Ms. Gesburg's quick departure. She hadn't even worked long enough for us to see if she was going to be an able employee or not, says Dr. Bogema. When someone leaves after only a few weeks, that level of trust disappears. The attitude shift among employees comes after months of turbulent times. Companies from Cisco and Lucent to WorldCom have slashed thousands of jobs since early 2001. Others have re-assigned employees at random, delayed start dates and forced job seekers to jump through all sorts of hoops before extending an offer. More recently, the scandals at Enron Corp. and Arthur Andersen, which have cost thousands their jobs and retirement savings, have intensified employee cynicism -- and validated their efforts to look after themselves.";1;0

Then came the anthrax postal scare, and the charity group's mail dried up for several weeks. For a nonprofit organization that gets more than half its funding in small donations through the mail, it was a staggering one-two punch, said development coordinator Shonna Milliken Humphrey.

Employees participating in the workplace fundraising campaign of the United Way of the National Capital Area had designated 1.4 million for SOME -- a whopping 40 percent more than in the previous year.

It offers condominiums and single-family homes in 18 areas in 11 states. DEVELOPMENTS Over the past year NVR rode the strong housing market, with its low interest rates and strong buyer demand, and earnings grew accordingly. For fiscal 2001, NVR earned 236.79 million, compared with 158.25 million in 2000. Gross revenue for 2001 was 2.62 billion, compared with 2.32 billion the year before. Executives at the builder attributed the increase to favorable market conditions and the company's focus on controlling costs. NVR is regarded as the country's most financially efficient home builder. It tends to earn a higher return than other builders because it doesn't tie up large amounts of capital in land purchases, choosing instead to buy options on lots. The company's present backlog of orders should ensure a revenue stream for a long time, analysts said. In a survey by the California research firm J.D. Power & Associates, consumers ranked Ryan Homes, an NVR affiliate active in the Washington market, the second-best builder in the country in terms of customer satisfaction. Approximately 48 percent of NVR's home settlements during 2001 occurred in the Washington-Baltimore region, which amounted to 59 percent of NVR's 2001 home-building revenue. NVR is thus heavily dependent on the economy and the demand for housing in the Washington area, which stayed relatively strong throughout 2001.";0;1

With lower interest rates, student borrowers could save thousands of dollars over the life of their loans. White House officials raised the idea of ending the government- subsidized consolidations as part of a supplementary spending bill for the current fiscal year being developed by the House Appropriations Committee. The proposal is one of three preliminary suggestions forwarded by the White House to deal with a 1.3 billion shortfall in the Pell Grant program for low-income students. It ran into immediate opposition from congressional Democrats, some Republicans and student advocates who said it would effectively raise interest rates for the estimated 700,000 borrowers who consolidate, or refinance their total federal student loan debt, each year. At a time when we are looking for ways to make college more affordable, it is inconceivable that the Bush White House would send a proposal to Congress that would make it harder for working families to pay tuition bills, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli D-N.J. said yesterday. Rep. George Miller Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the proposal grossly unfair to students who borrowed billions with the promise they could consolidate and get a better interest rate.

Employee salaries and benefits, which before two years ago accounted for about 60 percent of the county government's budget, will eat up 66 percent next year. That's an increase of 47.3 million. Although the county's population continues to grow, the increase wasn't driven by adding legions of positions During that time, the workforce grew by 2.7 percent. So what's going on Over the past few years, as health costs have grown and the economy has slowed, Duncan and the council have approved costly wage increases and sweetened retirements for police, fire and general government workers.

Around the world, people are spending record amounts of money to use its networks to talk and e-mail and exchange gobs of information. The pace of technological innovation is positively breathtaking. Trillions of dollars have been invested in its growth. Instead, the industry is in the midst of a financial meltdown. The ouster this week of founder Bernard J. Ebbers as chairman of WorldCom Inc. is but the latest twist in a saga that almost certainly will involve more resignations, more bankruptcies and a period of painful industry consolidation. The ripples from the telecom implosion extend well beyond the industry. It has become a significant factor holding back the economic recovery, not just in the United States but also globally. The stock market's current funk stems in significant part from concern over telecom stocks, which drove the late-'90s rally but since their peak have generated paper losses of more than 1 trillion, by some estimates. The amount of telecom debt and equity investments already written off by banks, bondholders, venture capitalists and private equity funds approaches 500 billion and continues to rise. Without expectations of robust growth in this debt-ridden, risky, increasingly competitive sector, the economics of the telecom sector simply don't work, declared Scott Cleland of the Precursor Group research firm in Washington, who sees no revival in sight. In the boom years, there seemed no limit to telecom's prospects. Success bred success, confidence led to more confidence, growth produced growth.

With the U.S. trade deficit still large, the weak-dollar boys are back selling their elixir to Congress. Our old friend Jerry Jasinowski, head of NAM, was his typically laid-back self this week, explaining that an overvalued dollar is decimating U.S. manufactured-good exports, artificially stimulating imports and putting hundreds of thousands of American workers out of work. How it managed to cause all of this mayhem while the economy was growing by some 5.8 in the first quarter must constitute a miracle. Either that, or maybe a strong greenback isn't quite the economic disaster he claims. The U.S. had a robust currency all throughout the 1990s when times were flush. The same was true for most of the 1980s, though we recall similar moaning about the Reagan dollar. The worst recent decade for U.S. economic policy was the 1970s, when the Nixon and Carter Treasuries decided to take NAM's advice and debase the dollar. Nirvana did not arrive. NAM's argument isn't economic policy so much as special pleading. Its members have to cope with rugged foreign competition, and they're looking for some government relief. They figure that the inefficient steelmakers got theirs -- tariffs -- so it's only fair that they now get a similar break. A dollar devaluation would be a kind of universal tariff on imports. You'd think Mr. Jasinowski would worry about the company he's keeping here. His allies include the AFL-CIO, that free-market paragon, and in the Senate the likes of Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, who has never met a tax or regulation he didn't like.

They aren't quite net sellers yet, but their net buying has almost dried up. That helps explain why the market has been soft -- especially the stocks of big, well-known companies favored by foreign investors -- and why the dollar has been under pressure.

Short-form data, released last year, pertain mostly to population counts, housing and race.
